Dozens of world leaders will attend the COP26 conference in Glasgow. Mr Kerry spoke as President Joe Biden signed a flurry of executive orders designed to address climate change. His latest edicts include a freeze on new oil and gas leases on public lands and set out to double offshore wind-produced energy by 2030. Mr Biden - who re-entered the US into the 2016 Paris climate accord in one of his first acts as president - said America must lead the response to the crisis. What did Kerry say? The newly appointed US climate tsar said: \"Glasgow will be extremely important. \"In fact, I would say that in my judgment, it is the last best chance the world has to come together in order to do the things we need to do to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. \"Three years ago, we were told we have 12 years to avoid those consequences. Three of those years were lost because we had Donald Trump, who didn't believe in any of it. And now we have nine years left to try to do what science is telling us we need to do.\" But at a White House news conference on Wednesday, Mr Kerry acknowledged the crisis would not be fixed even if the US reduced its emissions to zero. He said: \"He [Mr Biden] knows Paris alone is not enough. Not when almost 90% of all of the planet's global emissions come from outside of US borders. \"We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn't solved.\" During his four years in office, Mr Trump rolled back environmental regulations as he sought to maximise the nation's fossil fuel production. The Republican president also claimed credit for the US achieving a level of energy independence, becoming a net petroleum exporter, midway through his term. Mr Trump - who once called climate change a hoax - withdrew the US from the Paris pact, arguing that it unfairly left the world's other two top polluters - India and China - free to use fossil fuels. Nearly 200 countries signed up to the accord, which aims to keep the global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. America's moral authority problem By making John Kerry his Climate Envoy, Joe Biden isn't just appointing one of America's most experienced and senior politicians, he is also getting a man who is very deeply invested in making the process of international climate diplomacy work. John Kerry was President Obama's Secretary of State and was instrumental in negotiating the landmark Paris climate agreement, the first time virtually all the nations of the world agreed they needed to act to tackle climate change. No surprise then that he sees the Glasgow COP26 conference in November as the crucial forum for the world to come together to avoid really damaging climate change. His tone is emollient, however. He knows the US's virtual absence from climate talks during the Trump administration means he has to approach other world leaders with a sense of humility. America hasn't yet earned the moral authority to demand other nations take action. It is clear, however, that this veteran and wily political operator has every intention of using his formidable negotiating skills to try to ensure the world makes the most ambitious deal possible in Glasgow in November. What else did Biden say? The new US president indicated he would not wait until November's summit in Scotland to engage in multilateral talks on the climate issue. The series of executive orders that Mr Biden signed on Wednesday announced a US summit of leaders to be held in April on Earth Day. \"Just like we need a unified national response to Covid-19, we desperately need a unified national response to the climate crisis because there is a climate crisis,\" he said, establishing a White House office of domestic climate policy. Mr Biden directed the Department of the Interior to pause oil and gas drilling leases on federal lands and water and to launch a review of existing energy leases. Mr Biden aims to conserve at least 30% of federal lands and oceans by 2030. The new president - whose fellow Democrats control Congress - has signed over three dozen executive orders in his first week in office, more than any of his predecessors. Critics note he told ABC News while campaigning last October that only a \"dictator\" would use executive orders excessively. \"We're a democracy,\" said Mr Biden. \"We need consensus.\" Mr Biden endured a storm of criticism for last week's executive order halting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, that would have transported oil from Canada through the US. His White House is trying to get ahead of more criticism by addressing job creation. Mr Biden argued that \"millions\" of Americans would be able to find employment \"modernising our water systems, transportation, our energy infrastructure - to withstand the impacts of extreme climate\".", "summary0": "US climate envoy John Kerry has told the BBC a UN climate summit in the UK this November is \"the last best chance\" to avert the worst environmental consequences for the world.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-55836583", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Ya ce an rasa shekaru masu yawa kan wannan batun ƙarƙashin Shugaba Donald Trump, \"wanda bai yarda da lamarin ba sam-sam.\" Ana sa ran gomman shugabannin duniya za su halarci taron da aka laƙaba wa suna Taron COP26 a birnin Glasgow na kasar Scotland.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53220713", "lang0": "english", "text0": "The report, by China scholar Adrian Zenz, has prompted international calls for the United Nations to investigate. China denies the allegations in the report, calling them \"baseless\". The state is already facing widespread criticism for holding Uighurs in detention camps. It is believed about one million Uighur people have been detained over the past few years in what what the Chinese state defines as \"re-education\" camps. China previously denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism, following separatist violence in the Xinjiang region. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on China to \"immediately end these horrific practices\". In a statement, he urged \"all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanizing abuses\". China has faced mounting global scrutiny over its treatment of Uighurs in recent years. An investigation by the BBC in 2019 suggested that children in Xinjiang were being systematically separated from their families in an effort to isolate them from their Muslim communities. What's in the report? Mr Zenz's report was based on a combination of official regional data, policy documents and interviews with ethnic minority women in Xinjiang. It alleges that Uighur women and other ethnic minorities are being threatened with internment in the camps for refusing to abort pregnancies that exceed birth quotas. It also says women who had fewer than the two children legally permitted were involuntarily fitted with intra-uterine devices (IUDs), while others were coerced into receiving sterilisation surgeries. \"Since a sweeping crackdown starting in late 2016 transformed Xinjiang into a draconian police state, witness accounts of intrusive state interference into reproductive autonomy have become ubiquitous,\" the report says. According to Mr Zenz's analysis of the data, natural population growth in Xinjiang has declined dramatically in recent years, with growth rates falling by 84% in the two largest Uighur prefectures between 2015 and 2018 and declining further in 2019. \"This kind of drop is unprecedented, there's a ruthlessness to it,\" Mr Zenz told the Associated Press. \"This is part of a wider control campaign to subjugate the Uighurs.\" Former detainees in internment camps in Xinjiang said they were given injections that stopped their periods, or caused unusual bleeding consistent with the effects of birth control drugs. \"Overall, it is likely that Xinjiang authorities are engaging in the mass sterilization of women with three or more children,\" the report said. Politicians call for UN investigation In a statement on Monday, the Interparliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), an international cross-party group of politicians including Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, and US senator Marco Rubio, called on the UN to \"establish an international, impartial, independent investigation into the situation in the Xinjiang region\". \"A body of mounting evidence now exists, alleging mass incarceration, indoctrination, extrajudicial detention, invasive surveillance, forced labor, and the destruction of Uyghur cultural sites, including cemeteries, together with other forms of abuse,\" the statement said. \"The world cannot remain silent in the face of unfolding atrocities. Our countries are bound by solemn obligations to prevent and punish any effort to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group 'in whole or in part'.\" Coverage of China's hidden camps According to a report by the Associated Press published on Monday, women in Xinjiang have faced exorbitant fines and threats of internment for breaching childbearing limits. Gulnar Omirzakh, a Chinese-born Kazakh, was ordered to get an IUD inserted after having her third child, the AP reported. Two years later, in January 2018, four officials in military camouflage knocked at her door anyway and handed Omirzakh, the penniless wife of a detained vegetable trader, three days to pay a 17,5000 RMB (£2,000) fine for having more than two children. She was reportedly warned that she would join her husband in an internment camp if she refused to pay. \"God bequeaths children on you. To prevent people from having children is wrong,\" Omirzakh told the AP. \"They want to destroy us as a people.\" Responding to the report on Monday, China's foreign ministry said the allegations were \"baseless\" and showed \"ulterior motives\". Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused media outlets of \"cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues\". For decades, under China's one-child policy, urban minorities were instead allowed two children, or three for rural families. A 2017 policy change, under President Xi Jinping, removed the ethnic distinction, permitting Han Chinese to have the same number of children as minorities, while preserving the urban-rural distinction. But according to the AP, Han Chinese have been largely spared the abortions, sterilisations, IUD insertions and detentions implemented against minority populations, including the Uighurs. Mr Zenz's report characterises the alleged campaign of coercive birth control in Xinjiang as part of a \"demographic campaign of genocide\" against the Uighurs. \"These findings provide the strongest evidence yet that Beijing's policies in Xinjiang meet one of the genocide criteria cited in the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,\" he writes.", "summary0": "China is forcing women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices in Xinjiang in an apparent attempt to limit the population of Muslim Uighurs, according to new research.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-53228258", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Wani tsohon hoto na wata mace tare da yaranta a China a arewa maso yammacin lardin Xinjiang Rahoton wani malami a China Adrian Zenz ya janyo kiraye-kiraye daga sassan duniya cewa ya kamata Majalisar Dinkin Duniya ta gudanar da bincike na musamman kan abin da ke faruwa.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53060620", "lang0": "english", "text0": "The move comes just hours after the North renewed threats of military action at the Korean border. The site was opened in 2018 to help the Koreas - officially in a state of war - to communicate. It had been empty since January due to Covid-19 restrictions. In a statement, South Korea warned it would \"respond strongly\" if the North \"continues to worsen the situation\". The destruction of the office, it said, \"abandons the hopes of everyone who wanted the development of inter-Korean relations and peace settlement in the Korean Peninsula\". \"The government makes it clear that all responsibility of this situation lies in the North.\" Russia expressed concern at the renewed tensions between the Koreas. \"We call for restraint from all the sides,\" Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday. Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed senior US official as saying the Trump administration remained \"in close co-ordination with our Republic of Korea (South Korea) allies\". Tensions between North and South Korea have been escalating for weeks, prompted by defector groups in the South sending propaganda across the border. The North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo-jong - considered a close and powerful ally - threatened at the weekend to demolish the office. Her brother, Kim Jong-un, has ruled North Korea as Supreme Leader since 2011. There were hopes for improved relations between the North and the South and its close ally the US after Donald Trump met Mr Kim at the North-South border last June, but nothing materialised and the atmosphere has since deteriorated. North Korea is under crippling US and UN economic sanctions over its militarised nuclear programme. Washington has not yet commented on the North's latest action. Pyongyang has blamed the escalation on Seoul's inability to prevent defectors from flying anti-regime propaganda over the border. But it is likely that this is just being used as an excuse. The leafleting gives a \"cause\" for North Koreans to rally around. It was notable that once again, in the aftermath of the explosion, state media made reference to \"human scum\" - their description of North Korean defectors in the South. Kim Jong-un has failed to bring economic prosperity to his people and strict international sanctions remain in place. There are also persistent rumours that Covid-19 has affected rural parts of the country. Giving North Koreans a mutual enemy may help focus their attention elsewhere. Pyongyang is also angry at Seoul for not challenging Washington's insistence that strict sanctions should remain in place and for not pursuing inter-Korean projects which would have breached both UN and US sanctions. It feels as if North Korea could be punishing the South and with the aim of using the tension as leverage in future talks. Whatever the reason, this is a real slap in the face for a South Korean administration that pushed so hard for engagement. In recent weeks, North Korea has repeatedly condemned the South for allowing propaganda into its territory. Defector groups regularly send such material via balloons, or even drones, into the North. Last Tuesday, Pyongyang announced it was severing official communication links with Seoul, and over the weekend Kim Yo-jong threatened to send troops into the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the inter-Korean border. North and South Korea are technically still at war because no peace agreement was reached when the Korean War ended in 1953. What is the Kaesong liaison office? The border town of Kaesong has for years been a symbol of the fragile relationship between North and South Korea. In 2003, it sprung to life as the site of an industrial zone - the Kaesong Industrial Complex - set up between the North and South. At its peak, it saw more than 120 factories, employing more than 50,000 North Koreans and hundreds of managers from the South. But in 2016 it was shut down after tensions reached a head - bringing to a halt a symbol of co-operation. So, in 2018, it looked as though things were back on track when both Koreas agreed to set up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong. It allowed officials from the North and South to communicate regularly for the first time since the Korean War, and was meant to be staffed by up to 20 people from each side. But in March 2019, North Korea announced that it was withdrawing from the office - following a failed summit between the US and North Korea. Who is Kim Yo-jong? In recent years the younger sister of Kim Jong-un has emerged as a powerful ally. From 2014, Kim Yo-jong's main job was to protect her brother's image, taking up a key role in the party's propaganda department. When, in 2017, she was elevated to an alternate member of the politburo, it seemed to indicate a shift in seniority - although her main role remained in propaganda. In 2018, she shot into the international spotlight when, at the Winter Olympics, she became the first member of the Kim family to visit South Korea. Her continued rise shows she has gained the deep trust of her brother, and when Mr Kim's disappearance in April prompted questions about his health, she was mentioned as a possible successor. In recent weeks, she has been responsible for delivering several strongly-worded messages against the South - and has emerged as North Korea's new point-person on inter-Korean affairs, according to specialist site NK News. However, North Korea's power mechanisms are notoriously difficult to understand. It's therefore hard to gauge how much power - or how much of her own political network - the 32-year-old might have.", "summary0": "North Korea has blown up a joint liaison office with the South near the North's border town of Kaesong.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-53069752", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "The office was opened with great fanfare in September 2018 Matakin ya zo ne 'yan sa'o'i bayan Koriya Ta Arewa ta yi sabuwar barazanar daukar matakin soji a kan iyakar kasashen.

He'd dreamed of being a doctor. Like many of his classmates, he had moved to Kabul three months ago to prepare for the university entrance exams. On Saturday afternoon, Latif left the Kawsar-e Danish tutoring centre in the city after his usual daily four-hour class, and died moments later in a suicide bombing that killed 25 people and filled the street with dust and smoke. There was no way to reach Latif's parents by phone, so Hussain prepared himself to travel in person to their remote village in Ghazni province, many miles to the south. \"We are going to take Latif's body back to the village which he left to pursue his dreams,\" he said. \"How can we face his mother and father with the dead body of their son?\" On Monday, family members broke the news in person. Last week in Afghanistan there was at least one atrocity every single day. Latif's parents were just two of the many family members left bereaved by the violence, which despite ongoing peace talks seems only to be intensifying. The BBC looked back at one week in Afghanistan, at those who died and those who survived. Sunday 18 October Razia, her sister Marzia and her brother Nayeb are congenitally deaf. They go to a special sign language school in Ghor province and all sign to communicate. The three siblings had just started daily class on Sunday 18 October and were in their world of silence when a truck full of explosives detonated directly outside the building. \"It was the first time in my entire life I had heard anything,\" said Razia, who is 16. \"It was harrowing. My ears are deaf and unfamiliar with any sound but I heard a powerful noise in one ear.\" At least 16 people were killed, and more than 150 wounded. The explosion destroyed the school and surrounding buildings. Razia and her siblings were in class along with 19 other students. \"For a few moments I thought I was dead,\" she said. \"My sister was moving but I thought my brother was also dead. Luckily both are alive.\" Marzia, 18, heard the explosion too, she said. \"It was the first time I have heard anything. It was a loud, horrific sound that jolted my heart.\" A week after the attack, Marzia still wakes up from her nightmares and goes to her widowed mother for comfort. She is afraid to leave the house. The three siblings are among the lucky ones who survived. Most of the victims of the bomb were workers, and some families are mourning the loss of their only breadwinners. Amid their grief, they face destitution. Monday 19 October In Khost, a motorbike carrying explosives detonated near a wedding ceremony, killing at least four people and wounding 10 others. In Uruzgan province, two policemen were killed in a Taliban attack and four others were wounded. Tuesday 20 October At least five soldiers were killed and two wounded when a roadside mine was detonated next to a convoy in Nimruz province. The district police chief was among the dead. His young son Benyamin appeared on local TV to say he would take revenge on the Taliban when he grew up. \"I am saying this so Ashraf Ghani listens to my pain,\" he said, addressing the president. \"My dad died for Ashraf Ghani and he needs to hear my sorrow.\" Later that day, two hours from Kabul in Wardak province, a roadside bomb destroyed several civilian vehicles, killing at least 11 people. Wednesday 21 October In the early hours of Wednesday morning, the Taliban attacked a security base and killed more than 30 members of the police special forces in Takhar province in the north-east. Colonel Abdullah Gard, a local police chief, lost his 25-year-old son Farid in the raid. \"He is not dead, my son is still alive,\" Col Gard told the BBC. \"We won't forget him. His place won't be empty in our hearts.\" Farid had followed in his father's footsteps. \"My son was inspired by me and joined the police and, as we were in the same field, he was like a friend to me,\" Col Gard said. \"But I didn't lose only him. Some of the other brave soldiers who died with him were my soldiers. I knew most of them.\" Later on Wednesday, as night fell, Afghan Air Force jets were dispatched to exact revenge for the Taliban attack. They launched an air strike against a mosque in the same province, where in an adjacent religious school young boys were studying the Koran. Twelve boys were killed and 18 more wounded, along with their teacher, Abdul Wali. At a local hospital, one father, Abdul Razaq, told the BBC his two children were at the religious school when the strike hit. \"One of my children was killed and is still at the scene of the air strike,\" he said. \"I brought the wounded child here. I left my dead child on the ground to save the wounded one.\" In Afghanistan, violence takes its toll one way or another. The conflict has driven many civilians from their home towns, and even their country, to find refuge, work or medical care. That same day, in another part of the country - Nangarhar province in the east - at least 15 civilians including 11 women were killed in a stampede as people queued for visa applications in the city of Jalalabad. Early that morning, 60-year-old Niaz Mohammad returned home after his nightshift and the first thing he noticed was the absence of his wife, who had left home at 2am to secure a good spot in the queue at the Pakistani consulate. The first call Niaz Mohammad received said his 55-year-old wife, Bibi Ziwar had been hit by a car. He went straight to the hospital but they redirected him to the morgue, where he found her dead body. She had been crushed in the stampede. Bibi Ziwar was a mother to eight sons and three daughters. Some of them lived in Peshawar, across the border in Pakistan. \"She was missing her grandchildren,\" Niaz Mohammad told the BBC. \"They couldn't come to her, and she couldn't stand this distance any longer.\" Thursday 22 October In Badghis in the north-west, two brothers were killed by a roadside bomb. Local officials in the nearby city of Herat said the bomb had been planted by insurgents on a highway used by the military, but the two young victims were civilians. One was a university student. In northern Faryab province, at least four people were killed and 14 others wounded in what local officials said was a rocket attack by the Taliban. Friday 23 October At least 20 soldiers were killed in a Taliban attack in Nimruz province in the south-west. Local officials said that many others were wounded and six soldiers were taken hostage. Images were shared on social media showing the soldiers' corpses strewn in the desert, as well as images of the hostages, who appeared to be injured. Saturday 24 October As many as 600 students were at the Kawsar-e Danish tuition centre in the capital where Latif Sarwari lost his life in the suicide attack. The majority were from the Shia Hazara community, who Sunni extremists consider heretics, and there are growing concerns that these attacks are provocations intended to start a religious war. Most of the 25 victims of the bombing, like Latif, were teenagers. About 60 people were wounded. Tabish, 17, was among the survivors. He had left in a hurry to get to football practice and his long strides away from the school took him far enough to save his life. \"I was still at the end of the lane when the explosion happened. My very close friend, Mirwais Karimi - a very intelligent student - was killed. He sat next to me in the class and I can't believe he is not with us any more,\" Tabish said. Who carried out the attack is unclear. The Taliban denied involvement, while Islamic State militants claimed responsibility. But to the civilians wounded and the loved ones of those who were killed the end result is the same. The trail of violence through Afghanistan is long. Last week alone, people died in violence in more than 20 provinces. The numbers of civilian and government casualties are difficult to confirm. Taliban losses are even harder to establish. The UN mission in Afghanistan has documented 2,117 civilian deaths in the first nine months of 2020 and 3,822 more wounded. The violence is getting worse, even though the government and the Taliban have spent a number of weeks negotiating. \"After a week of horrific violence across Afghanistan, this news drains every last ounce of energy and hope,\" tweeted Shaharzad Akbar, the chairwoman of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, in response to last week. \"How much more can we endure, as individuals and as society?\" Tabish, who ran from the Kawsar-e Danish tuition centre for football practice but heard his friends die behind him, was taken to hospital to remove shrapnel from his legs. He was one of the survivors last week. \"I found my son alive, lying on a bed,\" his father Fraidon said at the hospital. He was struggling to comprehend that the bomber had targeted students. \"They just want to study, as is advised by God and his prophet,\" he said. \"I don't understand why they are being killed.\" Hafizullah Maroof, Bashir Paiman and Zuhal Ahad contributed to this piece.", "summary0": "It took Hussain Haidari three hours, and by the time he found his wife's cousin, Latif Sarwari, he had seen too many lifeless faces.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-54706404", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Razia ta tsira daga harin bam din motar da ta tashi a makarantar kurame Shekarun Latif 20, kuma yana mataki na 12 a makarantar sakandare.

The footage sparked a heated debate on social media, with some calling for her arrest for breaking the conservative Muslim country's strict dress code. Other Saudis came to the woman's defence, praising her \"bravery\". Women in Saudi Arabia must wear loose-fitting, full-length robes known as \"abayas\" in public, as well as a headscarf if they are Muslim. They are also banned from driving and are separated from unrelated men. In the video initially shared on Snapchat over the weekend, Khulood is seen walking along an empty street in a fort at Ushayqir Heritage Village, about 155km (96 miles) north of the capital Riyadh, in Najd province. Najd is one of the most conservative regions in Saudi Arabia. It was where the founder of Wahhabism - the austere form of Sunni Islam that is practised by the Saudi royal family and religious establishment - was born in the late 18th Century. The video was quickly picked up by Saudis on Twitter, where opinion was divided between those who believe Khulood should be punished and others who insisted she should be allowed to wear what she wanted. Journalist Khaled Zidan wrote: \"The return of the Haia [religious police] here is a must.\" Another user argued: \"We should respect the laws of the country. In France, the niqab [face-covering veil] is banned and women are fined if they wear it. In Saudi Arabia, wearing abayas and modest clothing is part of the kingdom's laws.\" The writer and philosopher, Wael al-Gassim, said he was \"shocked to see those angry, scary tweets\". \"I thought she had bombed or killed somebody. The story turned out to be about her skirt, which they did not like. I am wondering how Vision 2030 can succeed if she is arrested,\" he added, referring to the reform programme unveiled last year by Saudi Arabia's newly-appointed 31-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Some defended Khulood by noting that US President Donald Trump's wife, Melania, and daughter, Ivanka, had chosen not to wear abayas or headscarves during a visit to Saudi Arabia in May. Fatima al-Issa wrote: \"If she was a foreigner, they would sing about the beauty of her waist and the enchantment of her eyes... But because she is Saudi they are calling for her arrest.\" On Monday, the Okaz newspaper reported that officials in Ushayqir had called on the provincial governor and police to take action against the woman. The religious police, the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, meanwhile wrote on Twitter that it had been made aware of the video and was in contact with the relevant authorities.", "summary0": "The authorities in Saudi Arabia are investigating a young woman who posted a video of herself wearing a miniskirt and crop-top in public.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-40645385", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Ku kalli bidiyon a nan Matar mai suna \"Khulood\", mai tallar kayan zayyana ta baza hoton bidiyonta tana yawo a wani gidan tarihi da ke Ushayqir a kasar ta Saudiyya.

Mr Reagan, who was governor of California at the time, was angered that African delegates at the UN sided against the US in a vote. Members of the Tanzanian delegation started dancing after the UN voted to recognise China and expel Taiwan. Mr Reagan, who was a supporter of Taiwan, called the president the following day to express his apparent frustration. He said: \"To see those... monkeys from those African countries - damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes!\" Mr Nixon, who quit as president in 1974, can then be heard laughing. The recording was unearthed by Tim Naftali, a clinical associate professor of history at New York University, who directed the Nixon Presidential Library from 2007 until 2011. He published his findings in The Atlantic and wrote that the racist exchange was removed from the original tapes for privacy reasons. The tapes were released by the National Archives in 2000 while Mr Reagan was still alive. But he said the recordings were ordered to be reviewed following a court order. \"Reagan's death, in 2004, eliminated the privacy concerns,\" Mr Naftali said. \"I requested that the conversations involving Ronald Reagan be re-reviewed and, two weeks ago, the National Archives released complete versions,\" he added. According to Mr Naftali, Mr Reagan called Mr Nixon to press him to withdraw from the UN. But the president later said Mr Reagan's \"complaints about Africans became the primary purpose of the call\". Mr Naftali also said the president later told his secretary of state that Mr Reagan had described the Tanzanian delegation as \"cannibals\" that \"weren't even wearing shoes\". Mr Reagan publicly defended apartheid South Africa and the white-minority state of Rhodesia in the 1970s, and Mr Naftali said the newly-revealed recording \"sheds new light\" on this stance. He served as president from 1981 to 1989, at a time marked by the climax of the Cold War and the beginning of the end of Soviet communism.

The victims were travelling in a convoy of vehicles. The security minister said the group could have been targeted accidentally as a result of mistaken identity. Sonora state in northern Mexico is being fought over by two rival gangs, La Línea, which has links to the larger Juárez cartel, and \"Los Chapos\", which is part of the Sinaloa cartel. In a tweet President Donald Trump described the victims as a group of \"wonderful family and friends\" who \"got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other\". The US \"stands ready\", he said, to offer support to combat the problem of cartel violence and \"do the job quickly and effectively\". The FBI has offered to assist Mexican authorities in the investigation, CNN reports. Mexico's President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said Mexico would act with \"independence and sovereignty\" in pursuing the criminals behind the attack. A relative of the victims, Alex LeBaron, told CNN that the bodies of the deceased had been returned to their family ranch. What do we know about the ambush? A group of three mothers and their 14 children had set off in a convoy of three cars from Bavispe in Sonora state and were heading to the neighbouring state of Chihuahua. The women had been travelling together \"for safety reasons\", an unnamed relative told CNN. Nine people were killed after they were ambushed by gunmen in Bavispe. A burnt-out SUV was later found by the side of the road with the remains of some victims and there are reports that other family members were shot at as they tried to flee. An investigation has been launched and additional security forces have been sent to the area, the governments of Chihuahua and Sonora said in a joint statement. Claudia Pavlovich Arellano, governor of the state of Sonora, described the perpetrators as \"monsters\". \"As a mother, I feel anger, revulsion and a profound pain for the cowardly acts in the mountains between Sonora and Chihuahua,\" she wrote on Twitter, in Spanish. Julian LeBaron, a cousin of one of the women, said he did not know what could have motivated the killings, which he said had involved two separate attacks. \"We want to know exactly who was behind this, why they did it and from where they are, and we need that information to be true,\" he told Mexican radio. \"We don't know who would attack women and children.\" Who are the victims? Mr LeBaron gave a detailed account of the attacks in an an interview for Mexican radio station el Heraldo. His cousin Rhonita Miller, 30, four of her children, two of whom were babies, died in a car in the first attack, he said. Another cousin, Dawna Ray Langford, 43, and a woman called Christina Langford Johnson, 31 later left in separate cars and were ambushed in a second attack, he said. Both women were killed, along with two of Ms Ray Langford's children, aged four and six. Faith Marie Johnson, seven months old, survived and was found by Mr LeBaron in the car, according to his account. Seven children escaped, fleeing the scene, five of whom were injured and taken to hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Mr LeBaron added. Who are the Colonia LeBaron? The victims were members of a community called Colonia LeBaron which was founded by a breakaway Mormon group in the first half of the 20th Century after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the US starting cracking down on polygamy. The mainstream Mormon Church publicly rejected polygamy - the custom of having more than one spouse at the same time - in 1890 and since then, some groups who wished to continue the practice have broken away. The Colonia LeBaron community now includes both Mormons and Catholics who have settled there. Members are known for standing up to local drug gangs and speaking out about the high levels of cartel violence. It has about 3,000 members, some of whom practise polygamy. While local media say the convoy of cars may have been mistaken for that of a rival gang, the LeBaron community has been targeted by the cartels in the past. In 2009, Erick LeBaron was kidnapped for ransom. The community took a stand and said it would not pay for his release as that would just encourage future kidnappings. Erick LeBaron was eventually released without a ransom being paid. But months later, his brother Benjamin, who had led the campaign for Erick's LeBaron's release, was beaten to death. Benjamin's brother-in-law was also killed. In 2010, Julian LeBaron published an article in the Dallas Morning News calling for Mexicans to stand up against organised crime. Mr LeBaron also told Mexican radio on Tuesday that his family had received threats. \"We reported the threats, and these are the consequences,\" he said. Last year, the family also clashed with local farmers who accused the LeBarons of using excessive amounts of water to grow walnut trees on their land, allegedly leaving nearby farms dry. The Colonia LeBaron community has in the past demanded to be allowed to create its own security force. How bad is drug-related violence in Mexico? The power and influence of the Sinaloa cartel was on display last month when its members barricaded streets and clashed with security forces in Culiacán after one of their leaders, Ovidio Guzmán López, was arrested. With the security forces outnumbered and surrounded, the Mexican government took the controversial decision to free Ovidio Guzmán to prevent further bloodshed.

Mr Trump was born in New York but has increasingly spent more time at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. The president, a Republican, has been at odds with New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio - both Democrats. They both welcomed the news that the president was Florida-bound. \"Don't let the door hit you on the way out or whatever,\" tweeted Mr De Blasio. Mr Cuomo challenged Mr Trump's assertion that he had paid his taxes, adding: \"He's all yours, Florida.\" Mr Trump has never released his tax returns and refuses to disclose personal tax information. He has owned the Mar-a-Lago resort since 1985 and travels frequently between there and the White House. President Trump is running for a second term in next year's election and made clear on Thursday that he hoped to be in the White House for another five years. He said he would always cherish New York but added: \"Unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse\". The New York Times reported that President Trump and his wife Melania filed for residency in Florida in September. According to documents obtained by the Times, Mr Trump's \"other places of abode\" are listed as 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House) and his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. An apartment in Trump Tower, Manhattan, has been Mr Trump's primary residence since 1983. It is not clear if he will retain it. According to NBC News, President Trump has spent 99 days at Mar-a-Lago compared with 20 days at Trump Tower since taking office. The White House has not commented on the president's reasons for changing his permanent address but the New York Times quoted a person close to the president as saying that the reasons were mainly for tax purposes.

We take a look at some of the unresolved issues surrounding the late King of Pop. DR CONRAD MURRAY In the months before his death, Michael Jackson employed Dr Conrad Murray, a cardiologist with practices in Las Vegas and Houston, as his personal physician. He was with the singer on the day he died but the doctor has always maintained that nothing he did should have killed Jackson. On 8 February, 2010, Dr Murray appeared in court in Los Angeles and pleaded not guilty to the charge of involuntary manslaughter. He has since made two further court appearances in the case and remains on $75,000 (£50,000) bail. He is free to practice medicine, providing he does not administer powerful sedatives, such as Propofol. Dr Murray is due to appear in court again on 23 August, when Judge Michael Pastor is expected to set a date for a preliminary hearing, which should start within 60 days of that date. A trial date cannot be set until the process is completed and Judge Pastor has had an opportunity to consider the evidence. Dr Murray could be sent to jail for up to four years if found guilty. JACKSON'S ESTATE Like Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson remains a hugely powerful commodity from beyond the grave. According to estimates by music newspaper Billboard, the singer's estate made more than $1bn (£668m) since his death. The publication says album sales have generated about $383m (£259m) and revenue from the film, This Is It, amounted to nearly $400m (£267m). Jackson's This is It concerts, despite never taking place, also proved to be hugely profitable. Many fans held on to their tickets as souvenirs, instead of refunding them, which brought in about $6.5m (£4.3m), to be shared with the promoter AEG. The estate also made money from DVD sales, downloads, royalties and ringtones. It was revealed last week that the estate has agreed to foot the bill for Jackson's memorial service in Los Angeles, with $1.3m (£868,169) to be paid to the City of Los Angeles and the LA Police Foundation. THE MUSIC In death, Jackson achieved the musical comeback that he had yearned for in the latter years of his life. He was the biggest selling album artist of 2009, with 8.3 million sales, the vast majority of which were posthumous. In the past year, nearly 9 million of his albums have sold in the US alone, according to chart analyists Nielsen SoundScan. This is It, the film that documented the singer's rehearsals for his London concerts, is the highest-grossing concert film and documentary in cinematic history. Sony Music Entertainment will release 10 albums of Jackson's music over the next seven years, including one of previously unreleased material. THE CHILDREN Jackson's children, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (13), Paris Katherine Jackson (12) and Prince Michael Jackson II (8), commonly known as Blanket, are being cared for by their grandmother, Katherine, who was awarded guardianship in accordance with Jackson's wishes. The children have largely stayed out of the public eye, with the exception of Jackson's memorial service and the Grammy Awards ceremony. The children have been schooled at home although it has been reported that Michael Joseph (Prince) will attend a private school from September. THE FANS Jackson's fans are an ever-present force at court hearings for Dr Conrad Murray. They claim the charge of involuntary manslaughter is too lenient and have criticised prosecutors on the case. Many fans have vowed to continue fighting for \"justice\" for their idol. \"I love him even more than I did already,\" said Natalia Franco, at a recent hearing. \"It's just now that we're really grasping his message of love and humanitarianism,\" added Amy Kimes. \"On the one-year anniversary I'm very anxious...

Several other MPs from across the political spectrum also condemned the brutal gang-rape and murder. Protests were held across India after the victim's charred remains were found following her disappearance last week. Police say they have arrested the four men who gang-raped and murdered the woman. Rape and violence against women remain at high levels despite widespread public anger at high-profile cases. On Monday, the anger on the streets was reflected in parliament with many MPs demanding to know what action the government planned to take to make the country safer for women. Ms Bachchan, a former Bollywood actress who is very vocal on women's rights issues, led the MPs in demanding justice for the victim. \"I think it is time... The people want the government to give a proper and definite answer,\" she said. Watch: Victim's sister speaks out Vijila Sathyananth, an MP from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said the country was not safe for children and women and demanded that the \"four men who committed this crime should be hanged before 31 December. Justice delayed is justice denied\". Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said \"this act has brought shame to the entire country, it has hurt everyone\" and that he didn't have appropriate words to \"condemn this heinous crime\". He said tougher laws that were introduced after the December 2012 gang-rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi had given hope that crimes against women would decline. But since that had not happened, Mr Singh said, \"the government is ready for a discussion in the parliament on the issue of crimes against women and willing to explore stringent provisions in laws to check such incidents\". Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not yet commented on the case. What happened to the victim? The woman had left home on her bike at about 18:00 local time (12:30 GMT) on Wednesday to go to a doctor's appointment. She called her sister later to say that she had a flat tyre, and a lorry driver had offered to help. She said she was waiting near a toll plaza. Efforts to contact her afterwards were unsuccessful, and her body was discovered under a flyover by a milkman early on Thursday morning. Under Indian law, a rape victim cannot be identified even after death, but on Friday the woman's name was the top Twitter trend in the country for several hours as tens of thousands of angry tweets demanded justice. Her photographs have also been shared widely on social media by those demanding justice for her. What has the wider reaction been? At a police station on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Saturday, thousands of people gathered to protest, insisting the culprits must face the death penalty. Elsewhere in the country there were other protests and vigils for the victim. Meanwhile family members of the victim have turned away visiting politicians and police officials, demanding action instead. In the community of Shamshabad in Hyderabad, where she lived, residents locked the main gate and held placards saying: \"No Media, No Police, No Outsiders - No sympathy, only action, justice.\" Three police officers have been suspended following allegations by the victim's family that they had not acted quickly enough when the victim was reported missing. Officers suggested she may have eloped, relatives told the National Commission for Women, a government body. Rape and sexual violence against women have been in focus in India over the past few years but there has been no sign that anti-female violence is abating. According to the latest government crime figures, 33,658 women were raped in India in 2017 - an average of 92 every day.", "summary0": "An Indian MP has said the men who raped and murdered a 27-year-old vet in the city of Hyderabad should be \"lynched\".", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-50642494", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "An yi ta zanga-zanga a kasar Da take jawabi a majalisar, Jaya wadda matar fitaccen jarumin fina-finan Indiya ne Amitab Bachchan ta ce: \"Na san kalaman nawa sun yi tsauri, amma irin wadannan mutanen kamata ya yi a fito da su bainar jama'a a kona su.\" 'Yan majalisa da dama sun yi Allah-wadai da fyaden da aka yi tare da kisan matashiyar.

On the chalkboard, maths equations have been replaced by a vaccination schedule. Joseph Maina, who owns the central Kenyan school, has had to turn to nurturing animals to earn some money as he is no longer getting an income from providing an education. 'Vital for survival' Things were especially tough in March, when all the schools were told to close, as he was still repaying a loan and had to renegotiate with the bank. At first, it seemed that everything was lost, but \"we decided that we must do something [with the school] for survival\", Mr Maina tells the BBC. As private schools, which educate around a fifth of Kenyan children, rely on fees for their income, their enforced closure has meant that they cannot pay the staff and many are in serious financial trouble. A small number of schools have managed to continue teaching through online learning, but the fees they are getting barely cover teachers' basic living expenses, according to the Kenya Private Schools Association (KPSA). About 95% of the more than 300,000 private-school staff members have been sent on unpaid leave, KPSA chief executive Peter Ndoro says. In addition, 133 schools have been forced to close permanently. 'Never this bad' In order to avoid taking this drastic measure, Roka Preparatory, another school in central Kenya, has also converted its premises into a farm. \"Things have never been this bad,\" James Kung'u, who founded the school 23 years ago, tells the BBC. Outside, vegetables are now growing in what was the playground. He is also rearing chickens. \"My situation is similar to other schools. I struggle to fuel the car. The teachers and the students are no longer here. Psychologically, we are very much affected,\" Mr Kung'u says. Both Mwea Brethren and Roka have retained only two employees, who are helping with the farm work. \"It is not for riches. We are comfortable… at least you are not bored, you are busy and it's like therapy,\" says Mr Kung'u. No role for teachers While the two schools have found an alternative source of income, the owners worry about the fate of their teachers, who have had to go without pay for five months. This is in contrast to staff at state-run schools, who have been receiving their salaries. Mr Maina says some teachers in his school have called him to ask if there is anything they can do. \"But unfortunately we don't even have enough to feed ourselves,\" he says. As a consequence, many have turned to alternative professions. Macrine Otieno, who taught for six years at a private school in the capital, Nairobi, was evicted from her house after she was unable to pay her rent. She took a job as a live-in nanny to be able to get shelter and food. \"Since we had our first case of coronavirus in Kenya, and the schools were closed, there has been nothing for me to do. \"I have been trying to hustle a bit to find something for my child, but it has not been easy,\" she tells the BBC. You may also be interested in: Gloria Mutuku, a teacher in eastern Kenya, decided to become an entrepreneur and took a loan to start a business selling groceries when the schools closed. She hopes her business will do well and does not plan to go back to teach even when the schools reopen. Her idea is not uncommon and furthermore there is a question mark over whether the private schools will be able to reopen, as adapting to coronavirus could impose extra costs. KPSA wants the government to help resolve the financial problem through grants totalling $65m (£50m). It is also hoping that the teachers stay in the profession. \"There is need for the government to support private schools because they contribute so significantly to the economy and actually reduce the expenditure of the government on education,\" Mr Ndoro says. If the money is not forthcoming \"some of the schools may not be able to survive\", he warns. The ministry has offered help through a concessionary loan that will be available to those establishments that qualify but Mr Ndoro fears it won't be enough to save all the country's schools.", "summary0": "Kenya's decision to close all schools until next January because of coronavirus has left many of its private schools struggling to survive, as Basillioh Mutahi and Mercy Juma report.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-53892462", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Joseph Maina ya mayar da azuzuwa a makarantarsa wurin kiwon kaji Azuzuwan makarantar Mwea Brethren, wadda a baya take kaurewa da sowar ɗalibai, yanzu cike suke da sowar kaji.

President Donald Trump, who was also at the event last month, insists he is in good health and has not taken a test. One Democrat has also self-isolated after she met someone with the virus. There are more than 700 confirmed cases in the US and 26 people have died so far. Mr Cruz, Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz are all self-quarantining for the recommended 14-days after they met the same infected person at CPAC, a conservative political conference, at the end of February. Republican Representative Mark Meadows, President Donald Trump's newly appointed chief of staff, also met the person and is in self-quarantine. He is not exhibiting any symptoms and a precautionary test came back negative, a spokesman said. Mr Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence attended the same event in Maryland but neither of them interacted with the individual. Mr Trump did shake hands with the conference chairman who had had contact with the patient. But, on Monday, the White House announced that Mr Trump had not been tested for the virus. \"He has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed Covid-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms,\" a spokeswoman said. \"President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him,\" she added. What else did the White House say? The White House announcement came as it warned the number of cases in the US was likely to rise. \"There will be more cases,\" Mr Pence told reporters. \"But we simply ask today for the American people to engage in the common sense practices.\" The vice-president, who also confirmed he had not been tested for the virus, said the administration was consulting Congress on providing paid sick leave to workers. Separately, in brief remarks, Mr Trump said he would take \"major\" steps to protect the economy against the impact of the outbreak. \"We'll be discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief,\" he told reporters. He did not provide further details on his plans, but said there would be a news conference on Tuesday. \"This blindsided the world, and I think we've handled it very, very well,\" he said of the virus. The president's comments came as stock markets plunged. Shares around the world had their worst day since the financial crisis on Monday, and analysts described the market reaction to the coronavirus as \"utter carnage\". What's the latest in the US? Cases of the virus have been recorded in 34 states plus Washington DC. There have been 738 confirmed cases and 26 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, passengers aboard a virus-hit cruise liner in California have begun disembarking after being kept off the coast of San Francisco for five days. Nineteen crew members and two passengers on the Grand Princess have tested positive for Covid-19. Most of the passengers will go into quarantine at military bases or, if they require more immediate medical attention, nearby hospitals. Several hundred foreign passengers, including 140 Britons, will be repatriated to their home countries. The ship's crew members will remain quarantined on board, which will depart from Oakland as soon as the passengers have disembarked, officials said. The cruise ship came to the attention of the authorities when a previous voyager on the vessel died last week after being stricken by the coronavirus. The 71-year-old, who had an underlying health condition, had been on a round trip from San Francisco to Mexico. What about elsewhere? In neighbouring Canada, as of Monday morning, there were 76 confirmed or presumptive cases of people carrying the coronavirus disease. There was one confirmed death in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Most of the cases are in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, though some have also been discovered in Quebec and Alberta. Canadian public health officials are advising against all cruise ship travel. Just last week, Canadian passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship were released from quarantine. Italy now has the highest number of confirmed infections outside China, where the outbreak originated in December. It has confirmed 7,375 cases and overtaken South Korea, where the total number is 7,313.

The plant was due to open in 2017 but start-up was delayed for what officials said were safety requirements. The oil-rich UAE wants Barakah to meet a quarter of its energy needs, as it adopts more sustainable energy sources. Just two weeks ago the UAE sent a probe on a mission to Mars - another high-profile scientific first for the Gulf nation. The UAE is also investing heavily in solar power - a plentiful energy source in the Gulf. Some energy experts question the logic of Barakah, arguing that solar power is cleaner, cheaper and makes more sense in a region plagued by political tensions and terrorism. Last year Qatar called the Barakah plant a \"flagrant threat to regional peace and environment\". Qatar is a bitter regional rival of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Across the Gulf lies Iran, hostile to the UAE, and subject to US sanctions because of its controversial nuclear programme. Dr Paul Dorfman, head of the international Nuclear Consulting Group, wrote last year that \"the tense geopolitical environment in the Gulf makes nuclear a more controversial issue in this region than elsewhere, as new nuclear power provides the capability to develop and make nuclear weapons\". The London-based scientist also highlighted the risk of radioactive pollution in the Gulf. In a statement the plant's developer the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) said it was committed to the \"highest standards of safety and security\" and that the plant would play an important role diversifying and decarbonising the economy. \"The Barakah plant will supply clean baseload electricity to the grid - complementing intermittent renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind, which are not able to generate electricity on a continuous basis,\" it said. \"It will provide up to 25% of the UAE's electricity needs once fully operational and will help prevent the release of 21 million tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to removing 3.2 millions cars off the road annually.\" 'Important milestone' UAE leaders hailed the start-up on Saturday as a symbol of the country's scientific progress. The Barakah plant was developed by ENEC and Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). Energy will be generated by 1,400-megawatt pressurised water reactors, designed in South Korea, called APR-1400. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - the nuclear industry's main oversight body - praised Barakah in a tweet, saying the plant's Unit 1 had \"achieved its first criticality\" - that is, generation of a controlled fission chain reaction. \"This is an important milestone towards commercial operations and generating clean energy. IAEA has been supporting [United Arab Emirates] from the beginning of its nuclear power programme.\" The leader of Abu Dhabi, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, tweeted his congratulations \"marking this milestone in the roadmap for sustainable development\".

It comes after both chambers of Congress voted to prevent the sale. Some members of Congress said they feared the weapons could be used on civilians in the Yemen conflict. They have condemned Saudi Arabia's role in Yemen as well as last year's murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Senate would hold a vote within days on whether to override Mr Trump's veto, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday. But analysts say it is almost certain that the Senate will not have the necessary two-thirds majority to do so. It is the third time Mr Trump has used his veto power since taking office. In May, the White House issued a national emergency declaration to bypass legislators and push through the weapons sale. At the time Mr Trump said he made the decision because of the threat posed by Iran. But the move sparked fierce opposition on Capitol Hill from those who feared the weapons could be used against civilians in Yemen by Saudi-led forces. Lawmakers including some Senate Republicans also said there was no legitimate reason to bypass Congress. However, in issuing his veto Mr Trump suggested that barring the sale of US weapons could prolong the conflict in Yemen and that \"without precision-guided munitions, more - not fewer - civilians are likely to become casualties\". He also insisted that Saudia Arabia and the UAE were a \"bulwark against the malign activities of Iran and its proxies in the region\". Tensions between the US and Iran have risen sharply since Mr Trump took the US out of a deal between Iran and world powers to curb Iran's nuclear programme.

Twitter representative Katy Minshall admitted it was \"unacceptable\" that the site had relied wholly on users to flag abuse in the past. She said there was more to be done, but insisted Twitter's response to abuse had improved. Harriet Harman, chair of the Human Rights Committee, said: \"There is a strong view amongst MPs generally that what is happening with social media is a threat to democracy.\" SNP MP Joanna Cherry cited specific tweets containing abusive content that were not removed swiftly by Twitter. One example was only taken down on the evening before the committee hearing, after Ms Cherry and other high-profile figures, including the journalist and activist Caroline Criado Perez, drew attention to the post. \"I think that's absolutely an undesirable situation,\" said Ms Minshall, Twitter's head of UK government, public policy and philanthropy. Ms Cherry argued it was in fact part of a pattern in which Twitter only reviewed its decisions when pressed by people in public life. MPs also questioned how useful automated algorithms were for identifying abusive content. Facebook's UK head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, said their application was limited. For example, out of two million pieces of bullying content, Facebook's algorithms could only correctly identify 15% as in breach of the site's rules. \"For the rest you need a human being to have a look at it at the moment to make that judgement,\" she explained. Labour MP Karen Buck said algorithms might not identify messages such as, \"you're going to get what Jo Cox got\" as hostile. She was referring to the MP Jo Cox who was murdered in June 2016. \"The machines can't understand what that means at the moment,\" said Ms Stimson. However, both Ms Stimson and Ms Minshall said that their social networks were working to gradually improve their systems and were also implementing tools to better flag and block abusive content proactively, before it was even posted.", "summary0": "Facebook and Twitter executives have been grilled by MPs over how the social networks handle online abuse levelled at parliamentarians.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-45422818", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Jack Dorsey da Sheryl Sandberg sun isa birnin Washington DC kusan lokaci guda Babbar jami'ar Facebook Sheryl Sandberg ce ta wakilci kamfanin, yayin da shugaban Twitter Jack Dorsey ya wakilci nasa kamfanin.

The free Mid-Day Meal Scheme aims to tackle hunger and boost attendance in schools, but suffers from poor hygiene. Angry parents joined protests against the deaths, setting at least four police vehicles on fire. An inquiry has begun and 200,000 rupees ($3,370) in compensation offered to the families of each of the dead. Twenty-eight sick children were taken to hospitals in the nearby town of Chhapra after the incident and later were moved to Patna. A total of 47 students of the primary school fell sick on Tuesday after eating the free lunch. 'Food poisoning' There are fears the number of dead could rise as some of the children, all below the age of 12, are critically ill. The father of one sick child, Raja Yadav, said his son had been vomiting after returning from school and had to be rushed to hospital. The state education minister, PK Shahi, told the BBC a preliminary investigation indicated that the food was contaminated with traces of phosphorous. \"The doctors who have attended are of the tentative opinion that the smell coming out of the bodies of the children suggests that the food contained organo-phosphorus, which is a poisonous substance,\" he said. \"Now the investigators have to find out whether organo-phosphorus was accidental or there was some deliberate mischief.\" Earlier, doctors treating the patients had said \"food poisoning\" was the cause of the deaths. \"We suspect it to be poisoning caused by insecticides in vegetable or rice,\" Amarjeet Sinha, a senior education official, told the BBC. A doctor treating the children at a hospital in Patna said contaminated vegetable oil could have led to the poisoning. Patna-based journalist Amarnath Tewary says villagers told local reporters that similar cases of food poisoning after having Mid-Day Meals had taken place in the area previously. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar called an emergency meeting and ordered a team of forensic experts to the school, which is in Saran district. Bihar is one of India's poorest and most populous states. The Mid-Day Meal is the world's largest school feeding programme, reaching 120 million children in 1.2 million schools across the country, according to the government. Mr Shahi acknowledged \"that food is not being checked before it is being served\". He added that \"the scale at which the operation is being carried out, serving food to 20 million children every day and that too in remotest village schools, checking food before it is served - that itself is a challenge\".

President-elect Joe Biden called it an \"insurrection\", while Vice-President Mike Pence said the violence had been a \"dark day in the history of the United States Capitol\". But this is not the first time the building - regarded as the symbolic heart of US democracy - has been hit by violence. From bombs to foreign invasions, here are four other times the Capitol was attacked. British forces try to burn it down - 1814 Perhaps the most famous attack was by British forces during the War of 1812. British troops, led by Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cockburn and Major General Robert Ross - set fire to the still-under-construction Capitol after invading Washington DC in August 1814 (though the building survived thanks to a downpour). In retaliation for the Americans' burning of Upper Canada's capital at York a year earlier, the British troops also set fire to other parts of the city and key buildings, including the White House. The 1814 attack marks the only time that a foreign power has captured and occupied Washington. In 2014, the British embassy in Washington apologised after tweeting a picture of a White House cake surrounded by sparklers, \"commemorating\" the burning of the building 200 years before. Fourth of July dynamite attack- 1915 A century on from the British attack, Erich Muenter, former professor of German at Harvard University, exploded three sticks of dynamite in the Senate reception room. The explosion damaged the building, but nobody was killed. Muenter later said the attack was in response to American financiers aiding Britain against Germany in World War I. Writing under a pseudonym in the Washington Evening Star, Muenter said he hoped the attack would \"make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamour for war\", adding: \"This explosion is an exclamation point in my appeal for peace.\" A day after the attack, Muenter shot and injured financier JP Morgan Jr, before being subdued by Morgan's butler and arrested. He later took his own life. Attack by Puerto Rican nationalists - 1954 On 1 March 1954, four Puerto Rican nationalists pulled out the island's flag and shouted \"Freedom for Puerto Rico\" as they opened fire from the visitors' gallery of the House of Representatives, injuring five congressmen. \"I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!\" cried the leader, Lolita Lebron, during her arrest. Lebron was sentenced to 50 years behind bars, while the three men were given 75 years. The sentences were all later commuted by President Jimmy Carter. His administration said the release \"would be a significant humanitarian gesture and would be viewed as such by much of the international community\". The group returned to cheering crowds in Puerto Rico. 'Resistance Conspiracy' bomb - 1983 On 7 November 1983, an explosion ripped through the second floor of the Senate. Just minutes before the explosion, someone claiming to be from a group named the Armed Resistance Unit called a Capitol switchboard warning of a pending attack, saying it was in retaliation for US military actions in Grenada and Lebanon. There were no casualties but there was some costly damage. In 1988, FBI agents arrested seven members of the radical-left Resistance Conspiracy group for the Capitol attack and separate blasts at Fort McNair and the Washington Navy Yard in 1983 and 1984. Linda Evans and Laura Whitehorn were jailed for conspiracy and malicious destruction of government property in 1991.

Experts said the planets were so close as to appear almost on top of each other. One astronomer said it would probably be \"decades rather than years\" before they appeared as close together. While the planets have been visible to the unaided eye, viewers with a telescope have also been able to see Jupiter's four Galilean moons. People in the UK have taken to social media to share their photos of the planetary display. Viewed from London, the planets began appearing shortly before 06:00 GMT with the conjunction occurring just after. Those on high ground with a clear view of the eastern horizon had the best chance of witnessing the planetary display. Mark Thompson, an astronomer and former presenter on the BBC show Stargazing Live, said conjunctions occur when planets line up in such a way that they appear from Earth to be next to each other - despite in this case being hundreds of millions of miles apart. Mr Thompson told the BBC the cloudy atmospheres of the two planets made them appear bright to the naked eye. He said the event was not uncommon - Venus and Jupiter appeared together in 2015 and 2016, also on 13 November - but it was much rarer for them to appear so close to each other. \"There have certainly been cases where they've been close in the sky but they've not been this close in recent years, certainly the last couple of planetary conjunctions. \"This is actually quite a good conjunction because they're so close, and over the next few years they'll pass each other and be close but not this close… \"One as close as this, you're probably looking decades rather than years.\" The conjunction can also be seen in countries in the mid-northern latitudes, including parts of the US. Those who missed the event will be able to see the two planets again on Tuesday morning, but they will not be as close together. According to Nasa, stargazers will be treated to another planetary pairing later this month, when Saturn will meet Mercury on the western horizon at dusk on 24 and 28 November.

She said the president did not know most of the officials he had appointed. Mr Buhari, who is on a visit to Germany, has responded by saying his wife belonged in his kitchen. Standing alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a news conference, the president laughed off his wife's accusations. \"I don't know which party my wife belongs to, but she belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room,\" he said. The remarks earned him a glare from Chancellor Merkel. Mr Buhari said that having run for president three times and having succeeded the fourth, he could \"claim superior knowledge over her\". The influence 'of a few people' Mr Buhari was elected last year with a promise to tackle corruption and nepotism in government. But in the interview with Naziru Mikailu from BBC Hausa, Mrs Buhari said: \"The president does not know 45 out of 50 of the people he appointed and I don't know them either, despite being his wife of 27 years.\" She said people who did not share the vision of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) were now appointed to top posts because of the influence a \"few people\" wield. \"Some people are sitting down in their homes folding their arms only for them to be called to come and head an agency or a ministerial position,\" she said. His wife's decision to go public with her concerns will shock many people, but it shows the level of discontent with the president's leadership, says the BBC's Naziru Mikailu in the capital, Abuja. A turning point for Nigeria? Analysis by Naziru Mikailu in Abuja Aisha Buhari campaigned vigorously for her husband in last year's election in Nigeria, organising town hall meetings with women's groups and youth organisations across the country. However, she kept a low profile at the start of the administration and was barely seen or heard. She was restricted to her work on the empowerment of women and helping victims of the Boko Haram conflict in the north-east of the country where she is from. This is one of the reasons why this damning interview has caught the attention of many Nigerians. It is a significant blow for Mr Buhari, who has a reputation for being a tough, no-nonsense president. Her comments also bolster accusations that his government has been hijacked by a small group of individuals. Critics say a large number of people have been appointed because of their relationship with those people in one way or the other. Mrs Buhari was prompted to to speak out in an effort to end those practices so that party loyalists who contributed to his election victory could benefit. Her critics say she is speaking out only because she failed to convince the president to appoint her own people. However, as the closest person to the president, she must have exhausted all avenues before criticising him in the media. The comments could also mark a turning point for a government that has clearly struggled to deal with economic recession and is facing growing disquiet within the ruling party. The Nigerian economy, battered by low global oil prices and a currency devaluation, officially entered recession in August for the first time in a decade. Oil sales account for 70% of government income. The president famously remarked at his inauguration that he \"belongs to nobody and belongs to everybody\".

At the time, the World Bank and the IMF warned that the project would impose a heavy debt burden. The decision comes amid concern that many African countries risk defaulting on their debts to China. Aviation Minister Kabineh Kallon told the BBC that the project, which was due to have been completed in 2022, wasn't necessary and the country's current international airport would be renovated instead. He said current President Julius Maada Bio \"didn't see any need for Mamamah [the proposed airport]\" and was considering building a bridge from the capital to Lungi airport - the only international airport in the country. Currently passengers need to get a boat or helicopter to reach Freetown. Mr Kallon said he did not know whether the cancelled contract would lead to financial implications, and Sierra Leone remained on good terms with China. \"I do have the right to take the best decision for the country,\" he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme. China's ambassador to Sierra Leone, Wu Peng, told the BBC that relations would not sour between the two countries. \"I don't think the airport project should affect our future bilateral relations,\" he said. China is now the single largest bilateral financier of infrastructure in Africa - surpassing the African Development Bank (ADB), the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank and the Group of Eight (G8) countries combined. Critics say China is luring countries into debt traps by lending them money for massive infrastructure projects. In August, 16 American senators voiced their concern about \"predatory Chinese infrastructure lending\" in a letter to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Zambia's government has had to publicly deny reports that China could seize some of its parastatal companies if it defaulted on loan repayments. But China has denied claims that it is leading countries into a debt trap. \"If we take a closer look at these African countries that are heavily in debt, China is not their main creditor,\" China's special envoy for Africa, Xu Jinghu, told a news conference in September. \"It's senseless and baseless to shift the blame onto China for debt problems.\" Some Africans are also wary of the high levels of debt being built up and say the costs of some projects have been inflated by corruption, while others welcome China's involvement, saying that the roads, ports, railways and other projects are badly needed.", "summary0": "Sierra Leone has cancelled a $400m (£304m) Chinese-funded project to build a new airport outside the capital Freetown.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/45807430", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Tun lokacin yakin neman zabe shugaba Julius Maada Bio ya yi alkawarin nazari kan alfanun gina sabon filin jirgin Ministan sufurin kasar Kabineh Kallon ya ce a yanzu ba sa bukatar sabon filin jirgi, don haka za a yi wa tsohon da ake amfani da shi kwaskwarima.

The body of Roshani Tiruwa was found by her father last weekend in a stone and mud hut in the village of Gajra, in Achham district, 440km (275 miles) west of Kathmandu. Some communities in remote areas believe that they will suffer a misfortune such as a natural disaster unless menstruating women are secluded. While in isolation they are denied their usual intake of food and are prohibited from drinking milk. In many cases the huts that menstruating girls and women are banished to are shared with cattle and their excrement and are sometimes some distance from a village. They can be freezing cold in winter and stiflingly hot in summer. It is thought that many victims of the tradition suffer from mental and physical illnesses in later life. The chhaupadi rules mean that a menstruating female faces restrictions on where she can sleep, who she can see, where she is allowed to go and who she can touch. Critics say the government has not done enough to eradicate the practice and that it is has also been slow to prevent child marriages.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41693676", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Shingai NyokaBBC Africa, Harare Zimbabweans reacted with customary humour to the letter, which faked the signature and letterhead of the newly appointed cyber minister - Patrick Chinamasa - and instructed all WhatsApp group members to register with the ministry by November. The letter was signed \"By The Cyber Powers Vested In Me\". But the jokes have since subsided, and Zimbabweans are now considering what the new ministry will mean for their civil liberties - especially freedom of speech. 'A threat to the state' Zimbabwe's government has been uneasy about social media after pastor Evan Mawararire spearheaded the #ThisFlag movement last year. Using platforms like Twitter and Facebook it organised a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade. President Robert Mugabe's spokesperson, George Charamba, says Mr Mugabe came up with the idea of a new ministry to deal with an \"emerging threat to the state... a threat founded on abuse and unlawful conduct\". Social media is possibly the primary platform Zimbabweans use to communicate and receive news. It is thriving despite restrictive laws governing freedom of expression. Over the last 16 years, internet usage in the country has grown from 0.3% penetration to 46%, data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) shows. Several TV stations and online publications, some operating from the diaspora, use the internet to disseminate news out of the reach of the government. When petrol stations ran out of fuel last month, there were dramatic scenes of long queues at supermarket as Zimbabweans stocked up, anticipating food shortages. Worried by these events, the government blamed social media messages for spreading panic. \"Social media was abused to create a sense of panic, thereby creating some sort of destabilising in the economy,\" says Mr Charamba. The new cyber security minister, Mr Chinamasa, agrees. He commented at the time, before his appointment, that \"the cause basically was social media\". \"It means it's a security issue,\" he adds. \"It is also a political agenda, a regime change agenda. We are going to look at what exactly happened with a view to take corrective measures in the security arena.\" 'Muzzling' opinion But others say the government's stance is a threat to civil liberties. One communications rights group, the Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute for Southern Africa (Misa), says this new scrutiny of social media goes against the spirit of the constitution and freedom of expression. \"These unfortunate threats have resulted in self-censorship by [individuals] when engaging on topical issues affecting the country,\" it said in a statement. It also criticises censorship of Zimbabwe's media, \"who have on occasion been chastised for incorporating citizen opinion as expressed online in their reportage\". Going a step further, Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) says the government's new cyber threat ministry is a means for government to spy on its people. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai also believes that the ministry has been created to curb free speech in time for the 2018 polls. \"Mugabe... will do whatever it takes to control and muzzle social media in order to suppress public discontent against his regime,\" he said. \"However the good news is that the regime has no capacity to suppress the use of social media.\" Many Zimbabweans have reacted wryly to the news of the creation of a cyber minister, referring to Mr Chinamasa as the \"Minister of WhatsApp\". Some say the ridicule shows a lack of understanding about the global threat of cyber crime. Others see a link between the government's scrutiny of online communication and the forthcoming elections. Zimbabwe already has several pieces of legislation which rights groups say curb freedom of expression. Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights says that since 2010, it has assisted more than 100 people arrested under a law which makes it a jailable offence to \"insult the president\" and \"undermine his authority\". Ordinary people have been arrested and charged for calling the 93-year-old leader \"old\", \"a donkey\" and even for accusing him of ruining the country. The Zimbabwean government has said new legislation will not stifle freedom of expression and will protect the public from new threats such as revenge pornography and cyber attacks. Presidential spokesperson Mr Charamba says Zimbabwe will look closely at how other nations have dealt with the threat of cybercrime - including Russia, China, and South Korea \"who have faced similar challenges\". Arrests ahead? While several countries around the world have anti-cyber crime departments and agencies, Zimbabwe is among the first to create an entire ministry. Meanwhile on social media, ominous warnings have begun circulating. One is from a \"Mr Chaipa\", urging Zimbabweans only to share content on social media that they would be able to defend in court. Mr Chaipa said it was easy for the government to monitor online messages, and gave a list of online activities that could be classified as criminal offences. \"In the coming months a lot of people will be arrested and used as examples to deter people from 'abusing' social media towards the elections,\" he warns. \"Don't be made an example.\"", "summary0": "A spoof government notice hit social media as soon as President Robert Mugabe announced he had set up a new ministry responsible for Cyber Security, Threat Detection and Mitigation.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-41724060", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "'Yan Zimbabwe sun rika raha suna bayyana sabon ministan tsaro a harkar Internet a matsayin \"Ministan WhatsApp\" Al'ummar Zimbabwe dai sun yi ta raha kan wasikar wacce ke dauke da sa hannu da kuma adireshi na boge na sabon ofishin ministan samar da tsaro a harkar Internet, Mr Patrick Chinamasa wanda ke umurtar duk masu amfani da WhatsApp a matsayin dandali da su yi rijista a ma'aikatar nan da watan Nuwamba.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50068625", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Chris EwokorBBC Africa, Abuja Mannir Awal Addo, a trader in Abuja who has family that he visits every weekend in Kaduna, was kidnapped on the Abuja-Kaduna highway earlier this year and held for five days. He told the BBC that he paid his abductors $1,300 (£1,000) for his freedom: \"It was a traumatic experience.\" He was affected by polio as a child and said he could not run away when kidnappers attacked the vehicle he was travelling in. \"Since then, honestly I don't use car transport because I am afraid of the road. It's better for me to take the train because of its safety.\" By road the 150km (93-mile) journey between the two cities is cheaper and shorter, but it has become a matter of life and death as dozens of travellers are kidnapped along the highway - and many are killed. When, thanks to a $500m Chinese loan, the train line linking Abuja to Kaduna opened in 2016 people used it more for its novelty value, given that most the country's railway system is a relic from the colonial era. Brawling for tickets But now it is hard to get a ticket for the four round-trips made each day, with 5,000 commuters packing on to them daily. The demand is high because nine armed police officers are on board guarding the train's six carriages. A one-way ticket is sold for about $4 for economy and $8 for business class - and there are usually long queues to get them. Many passengers miss scheduled trips because of the huge demand. Many of the civil servants who work in the capital live in Kaduna. In August, users posted images of stranded passengers brawling over tickets at a train station. Officials have also been accused of hoarding tickets and selling them at inflated rates in a racketeering scheme, prompting the government to say it is considering automating the process. Those who have tickets but cannot find seats have the option of standing for the two-hour journey for the same fee. You may also be interested in: When I joined 600 passengers on the 09:45 from Abuja, more than 50 were standing in my carriage. Others were squeezed into the spaces between the carriages and by the toilets. It is a choice many are happy to make rather than use what has been dubbed Nigeria's most dangerous road. The highway is bordered on each side by thick rows of neem and baobab trees, providing excellent cover for the armed gangs hiding in wait. Kidnappers in Nigeria are not fussy. They abduct both rich and poor, often collecting ransoms of up to $150,000 and as low as $20 - sometimes killing those whose families fail to pay. \"At its height, the road had 10 kidnappings per day with 20 different groups operating on the route,\" says police commander Abba Kyari, who heads a special unit fighting kidnappers. The true figures are likely to be higher, as some families, like that of Mr Addo, choose not to report to officials, deciding to negotiate with the kidnappers directly. Train passenger and postgraduate student Idris Mohammed, who used to travel by road to Kaduna for the weekends, is happy to pay more for his safety as \"the roads are too dangerous now\". Why don't people live in Abuja? For most of the civil servants who work in the capital annual rents as high as $15,000 are just too expensive. Many live to the north in Kaduna, the commercial hub of northern Nigeria, where housing is cheaper. A cosmopolitan city, Kaduna is very different to Abuja, bristling with divergent interests, but with simmering tensions over ethnic, political and religious issues. By contrast, Abuja is a slow-paced, administrative city. It became Nigeria's capital in 1991 and has grown up from a small village to become home to many diplomats and foreign NGO workers. It was chosen as the capital because of its central location - which means that many people come from elsewhere in the country to work there, so on weekends it really empties out. And its fairly well-heeled daily and weekly commuters are prime targets for kidnappers. Bus stations suffering But the popularity of the trains is bad news for buses. Despite buses charging at least six times less than the trains, many of the big bus stations, which used to be bustling with passengers and luggage, are now empty. An official from the transporters' union told me the safety the trains could provide was the main reason. Many of those who still use the road do so in private cars and set off at mid-morning or early afternoon. Those who travel later place their faith in the several police check-points along the road to try to deter kidnappers. Though the police have recorded a few successes against the kidnappers, including the 2017 arrest in south-west Lagos of an alleged kidnap kingpin, some people still question the seriousness of security agencies in tackling the problem. For now the train is a welcome haven - and the only recent security issue has been over cattle. In September last year, the armed police escorts fired live rounds into the air to disperse villagers on the outskirts of Kaduna who had gathered to attack a train after 50 cows were crushed crossing the track.

Supporters say they expect the law to be blocked in court but hope that the appeals process will bring it before the Supreme Court. They want the court, which now has a conservative majority, to overturn the 1973 ruling legalising abortion. Alabama's 35-seat Senate is dominated by men, and none of its four female senators backed the ban. It was then signed by Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey. Sixteen other states are seeking to impose new restrictions on abortion. Earlier this year the Supreme Court blocked implementation of new abortion restrictions in Louisiana. However the ruling was made by a narrow margin and the case is due to be reviewed later this year. Why is this happening now? The bill's architects expect that it will be defeated in the lower courts, but hope that it will therefore eventually come before the Supreme Court. They have been emboldened by the addition of two conservative justices nominated by President Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who give the nine-member court a conservative majority. Their aim, they say, is for the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade ruling to be undermined or overturned completely. Alabama's Lieutenant Governor Will Ainsworth said: \"Roe must be challenged, and I am proud that Alabama is leading the way.\" Eric Johnston, who founded the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition that helped draft the bill, told NPR: \"The dynamic has changed. \"The judges have changed, a lot of changes over that time, and so I think we're at the point where we need to take a bigger and a bolder step.\" What is in the Alabama bill? Under the bill, doctors face 10 years in prison for attempting to terminate a pregnancy and 99 years for carrying out the procedure. A woman who has an abortion would not be held criminally liable, and abortion in cases where the mother's life is at serious risk are allowed. The state Senate approved the law by 25 votes to six, rejecting exemptions for cases of rape or incest, with some noting all those voting for the bill were men. 'Why are we here again?\" by Ritu Prasad, BBC News, Alabama Democrats here in Alabama knew they had no chance of stopping this controversial bill, but that only seemed to make the debate on the senate floor even more heated. Activists packed the senate gallery to watch the drama play out - reacting with laughter and gasps in turn. The few women who spoke on the floor were quick to highlight a key fact: this decision about women's bodies was being made almost entirely by men. As one female lawmaker introduced a sure-to-fail amendment to the bill to make it illegal for men to get vasectomies, the gallery and overflow watch room upstairs burst into laughter. On the senate floor, when the amendment failed, the lawmaker made her point, saying: We have never policed men's bodies the way we do women's. Just outside the stark white walls of the state legislature were still more pro-choice advocates, raising signs that called for women's equality, for protecting Planned Parenthood, for men to stay out of women's rights issues. One exasperated young woman told me: \"We've already had this vote about women before. In the 70s. Why are we here again now?\" What restrictions are other states enacting? Earlier this year the governors of four states - Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio - signed bills banning abortion if an embryonic heartbeat can be detected. Opponents say this amounts to a ban on abortion because cardiac activity in an embryo can be detected as early as the sixth week, before a woman may be aware that she is pregnant. You may also be interested in: The Guttmacher Institute, which campaigns for reproductive rights, says none of these bans are yet in effect, but their introduction is part of the same strategy to get the cases heard by the Supreme Court, it says. Overall 28 states are currently considering legislation that would ban abortion in a variety of ways, it says. What reaction has there been? Dr Yashica Robinson, who is one of the few doctors left providing abortion in Alabama, told BBC Radio Four's PM programme that she would continue to do her job while fighting for women's access to abortion in the state. \"I will still be here taking care of women and doing the things I can legally do,\" she said. \"Then, I will be helping women to the places they need to be in order to get the healthcare that they desire or need if they are going to make it difficult here.\" Alabama Democratic state Senator Bobby Singleton said the bill \"criminalises doctors\" and was an attempt by men \"to tell women what to do with their bodies\". Several Democratic presidential hopefuls also reacted on social media, including Kamala Harris. The National Organization for Women called the ban \"unconstitutional\" and said it was \"a transparent effort to drum up political support for anti-abortion candidates in upcoming elections\". Staci Fox of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates called the decision \"a dark day for women in Alabama and across this country\". In a statement she said Alabama politicians would \"forever live in infamy for this vote and we will make sure that every woman knows who to hold accountable\". What is access to abortion like in the US? There are currently three abortion clinics in Alabama, down from more than 20 in the 1990s, according to pro-choice campaigners. Other states have seen similar falls in the number of abortion clinics and in 2017, six states reportedly had just one abortion clinic in operation. However states with liberal majorities are seeking safeguards to the right to abortion in their own constitutions.", "summary0": "Alabama has become the latest US state to move to restrict abortions by passing a bill to outlaw the procedure in almost all cases.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/48291368", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Mata da 'yan mata sun cika titunan jihar Alabama dan nuna adawa da dokar Masu rajin kare hakkin jama'a sun sha alwashin zuwa kotu don hana amfani da dokar a Alabama, wadda tuni ta tunzura mata.

Mass killings are defined as four or more people being killed in the same incident, excluding the perpetrator. Among the deadliest in 2019 were the killings of 12 people in Virginia Beach in May and 22 in El Paso in August. Of the 41 cases in 2019, 33 involved firearms, researchers said. California had the highest number of mass killings per state, with eight. The database has been tracking mass killings in the US since 2006, but research going back to the 1970s did not not reveal a year with more mass killings, AP reported. The year with the second-highest number of mass killings was 2006, with 38. Though 2019 had the highest number of incidents, the death toll of 211 was eclipsed by the 224 people who died in mass killings 2017. That year saw the deadliest mass shooting in US history, when 59 people were gunned down at a festival in Las Vegas. Many mass killings in the US fail to make headlines because they involve family disputes, drug deals or gang violence, and don't spill into public places, the researchers said. The number of mass killings in the US had risen despite the overall number of homicides going down, said James Densley, a criminologist and professor at Metropolitan State University in Minnesota. \"As a percentage of homicides, these mass killings are also accounting for more deaths,\" he told AP. Prof Densley said he believed the spike was partly a consequence of an \"angry and frustrated time\" in US society, but he added that crimes tended to occur in waves. \"This seems to be the age of mass shootings,\" he said. Gun ownership rights are enshrined in the second amendment of the US constitution, and the spike in mass shootings has done little to push US lawmakers towards gun control reforms. In August, following deadly attacks in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, President Donald Trump said \"serious discussions\" would take place between congressional leaders on \"meaningful\" background checks for gun owners. But Mr Trump quietly rowed back on that pledge, reportedly after a long phonecall with Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association - a powerful lobby group which opposes gun control measures. Speaking to reporters after the call, the president said the US had \"very strong background checks right now\", adding that mass shootings were a \"mental problem\". Leading Democrats have called publicly for stricter gun control measures. Earlier this month, presidential candidate and former US Vice-President Joe Biden used the seventh anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting to renew a call for tighter regulations. Mr Biden's plans include a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and mandatory background checks for all gun sales. Another Democratic presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, outlined plans earlier this year to reduce gun deaths by 80% with a mixture of legislation and executive action. Ms Warren has also called for stronger background checks, as well as the ability to revoke licences for gun dealers who break the law.", "summary0": "The US suffered more mass killings in 2019 than any year on record, according to researchers.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-50937521", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Akalla mutum 22 aka kashe a harin El Paso a Texas a watan Agusta Binciken wanda kamfanin dillacin labaru na AP da USA Today da kuma jami'ar Northeastern suka gudanar ya tattara bayanai ne daga abubuwan 41 da suka faru, da suka shafi mutuwar sama da mutum 200.
