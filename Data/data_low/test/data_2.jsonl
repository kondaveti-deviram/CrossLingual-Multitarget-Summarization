Facebook said not all the apps posed a threat to users. The company came under huge pressure in 2018 after it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had accessed many users' data without permission. The political consultancy firm is alleged to have used this data - harvested by a personality quiz - to target political advertising. Facebook was fined $5bn in July by the US Federal Trade Commission, in what was believed to have been the biggest ever fine imposed on any company for violating consumers' privacy. Why is Facebook suspending apps? The Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the data of tens of millions of people, was hugely damaging for Facebook and the company has since faced lawsuits and international criticism. It is now seeking to improve its privacy safeguards and its image. As part of that, in March last year Facebook launched an investigation into apps on its platform, involving hundreds of lawyers, data scientists and engineers. \"Our review helps us to better understand patterns of abuse in order to root out bad actors among developers,\" the company's vice-president for product partnerships, Ime Archibong, said in a statement on Friday. What do we know about the apps? Facebook has released little specific information on the tens of thousands of apps or hundreds of developers in question. The statement said that the suspension of the apps was not necessarily an indication that they posed a threat to people. \"Many were not live but were still in their testing phase when we suspended them,\" Mr Archibong said. In some cases developers were subjected to in-depth questioning after being flagged. Some apps were banned completely for reasons including inappropriately sharing data obtained from Facebook or making data publicly available without protecting people's identity. One banned app called myPersonality was found to be sharing information with researchers and companies with only limited protections in place, and then refused to take part in an audit, according to Facebook. The app review is ongoing.", "summary1": "Facebook says it has suspended tens of thousands of apps as part of an investigation it launched in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data harvesting scandal."}

The protests started over cuts to bread subsidies in December but have since morphed into anger at Mr Bashir's rule. The Sudanese government says 30 people have been killed in clashes since the unrest began. Human rights groups put the death toll at more than 40. What did President Bashir say? Mr Bashir used a rally of his supporters in the eastern city of Kassala to mock his political opponents. He said only elections could bring about a change of government. \"This is our pledge and commitment before the Sudanese people. The decision is your right, the masses of the Sudanese people,\" the president said. The Sudanese authorities have tried to block social media in the country. But a medic in Khartoum told the BBC earlier this week that people have been bypassing the blockade by using Virtual Private Networks (VPN), which can hide a user's location. In Kassala, near the Eritrean frontier, Mr Bashir also said that Sudan was reopening its border with Eritrea after about a year-long closure. The eastern frontier was shut after Sudan declared a state of emergency in two regions to tackle weapons trafficking. What's the latest on the protests? As Mr Bashir was speaking in Kassala, new rallies broke out in the capital and elsewhere. Riot police fired tear gas at crowds in Khartoum, a witness told the AFP news agency. Protests were also held in several villages south of the capital. The demonstrations are being led by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which represents health workers, lawyers, teachers and others. The protests started over cuts to bread and fuel subsidies, but now demonstrators are calling for the 75-year-old president to resign. Mr Bashir, who has won elections several times since coming to power in a coup in 1989, has struck a defiant note. On Wednesday, the Sudanese armed forces - who back the president - warned they would not allow a collapse of the state.", "summary1": "Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has ridiculed his opponents' use of social media to organise recent protests against his rule."}

Africa had witnessed the most dramatic rise - up 700%. The agency said actual numbers may be far greater, since only one in 10 cases globally are reported. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs and brain. Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people. Since September, at least 800 people have died from measles in Madagascar alone. Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, \"causing many deaths - mostly among young children\", while a spike in case numbers was reported for countries including the US and Thailand with high levels of vaccination coverage. In total, some 170 countries reported 112,163 measles cases to WHO, in comparison to 28,124 cases across 163 countries during the same period in 2018. The UN says the disease is \"entirely preventable\" with the right vaccines, but global coverage of the first immunisation stage has \"stalled\" at 85%, \"still short of the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks\". In an opinion piece for CNN, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UNICEF head Henrietta Fore said the world was \"in the middle of a measles crisis\" and that \"the proliferation of confusing and contradictory information\" about vaccines was partly to blame. Why the sudden 'global measles crisis'? By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News It is one of the most contagious viruses around. However, nothing about measles has changed. It has not mutated to become more infectious or more dangerous. Instead the answers are entirely human. There are two stories here - one of poverty and one of misinformation. In poorer countries fewer people are vaccinated and a larger portion of the population is left vulnerable to the virus. This creates the environment for a large outbreak to occur - such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kyrgyzstan and Madagascar. But rich countries with seemingly high vaccination rates are seeing cases spike too. This is because clusters of people are choosing not to vaccinate their children due to the spread of untrue anti-vax messages on social media. It is worth noting these figures are provisional, the WHO says the true figures will be much higher. And that measles is far from harmless. It kills around 100,000 people, mostly children, every year. The pair wrote that it was \"understandable, in such a climate, how loving parents can feel lost\" but that \"ultimately, there is no 'debate' to be had about the profound benefits of vaccines\". They added: \"More than 20 million lives have been saved through measles vaccination since the year 2000 alone.\" In response to recent measles outbreaks, calls have mounted in several countries to make immunisation mandatory. Last month, Italy banned children under six from attending schools unless they had received vaccines for chickenpox, measles and other illnesses. A public health emergency has also been declared in areas of New York, ordering all residents to be vaccinated or face a fine.", "summary1": "The number of measles cases reported worldwide in the first three months of 2019 has quadrupled compared with the same time last year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)."}

She said she feared being killed if she was sent back to her family. \"It's something that is worth the risk I took,\" she told the Toronto Star and CBC News. \"I had nothing to lose.\" \"We are treated as an object, like a slave,\" she said. \"I wanted to tell people my story and about what happens to Saudi women.\" Under Saudi Arabia's guardianship system, women must obtain permission from a male relative to travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married or even leave prison. Ms Mohammed - who has dropped her surname, al-Qunun - alleged that her family had subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. \"In the beginning they locked me up for six months after I cut my hair... because it is forbidden in Islam for a woman to dress like a man,\" she told reporters at the office of an immigrant settlement agency in Toronto. \"But I was mostly exposed to violence by my mother and my brother,\" she added. \"They were beating me and there was corporal violence.\" While she was in Thailand, Ms Mohammed also told the BBC that she had renounced Islam - a crime that is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. She had been on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight to Bangkok on 5 January, saying she intended to take a connecting flight to Australia and had an Australian visa. But she says her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight, leaving her stranded. Ms Mohammed then sent a series of tweets pleading for help from her hotel room. \"During this time, I was thinking about what kind of goodbye messages I would write, because I was not going to allow them to take me. I was prepared to end my life before they kidnapped me,\" she told CBC. Her case was picked up by Human Rights Watch and numerous journalists. Thailand eventually allowed her to stay and the UN assessed her claim for asylum. On Tuesday, Ms Mohammed gave a statement to media in Toronto and called herself \"one of the lucky ones\". She said that she wants \"to be independent, travel, make my own decisions on education, a career, or who, and when I should marry\". \"I had no say in all this,\" she said in Arabic. \"Today I proudly say I am capable of making all those decisions.\" Last Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that his country would accept Ms Mohammed as a refugee. The following day she was met at Toronto's international airport by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland. Ms Freeland and her ministry enraged the Saudi government in August when they called for the release of several women's rights activists campaigning for the male guardianship system to be abolished who were detained as part of an apparent crackdown on dissent. Riyadh responded by freezing all new trade with Canada and expelling its ambassador over its \"interference\" in the kingdom's domestic affairs. The Saudi government has not commented since Ms Qanun's arrival, but the head of the state-funded National Society for Human Rights said on Monday that he had been \"surprised by some countries' incitement of some Saudi female delinquents to rebel against the values of their families\". \"I feel very safe in Canada, a country that respects human rights,\" Ms Mohammed said. She added: \"I feel born again from feeling the love coming from everyone waiting for my arrival.\" Ms Mohammed said that, although the Canadian weather may take some getting used to, she was excited for the new experiences ahead. \"I will try things I haven't tried,\" she said. \"I will learn things I didn't learn. I will explore life.... I will have a job and live a normal life.\" Like a typical 18-year-old, one of the first things Ms Mohammed did upon her arrival, after getting clothing appropriate for the Canadian winter, was purchasing a smart phone, an official at the immigrant settlement agency said. The Canadian government offers refugees financial support for up to a year, as well as help with finding housing and registering for federal and provincial programmes, and English lessons. Mario Calla, executive director with Costi Immigrant Services, which is assisting Ms Mohammed in Canada, said they have temporarily hired a private security guard for the Saudi teen because of the threats she has received on social media. He said that because of the possible risks they are considering settling her - at least for the foreseeable future - with a family to ensure she is not living alone. Her fast-tracked refugee claim has not been received entirely without criticism and Mr Trudeau was asked this week what message it sent to the many other refugee claimants hoping for Canadian asylum.

On Monday police chief Ed Kraus told reporters Mr Dean had resigned from the force. Atatiana Jefferson was killed after two officers responded to a non-emergency call from her neighbour. Body cam footage showed an officer shooting within seconds of seeing her. The man who called police, James Smith, 62, said he was trying to be a good neighbour after noticing Ms Jefferson's front door was open and her lights were on. \"If I had never dialled the police department, she'd still be alive.\" Mr Smith told local media. \"It makes you not want to call the police.\" Allegations of police brutality in black communities have been a longstanding issue in the US. In its initial statement, the Fort Worth Police Department said the officer had \"perceived a threat\" when he drew his weapon. Police Chief Kraus said he would have fired the officer, had he not resigned, \"for violations of several policies including our use of force policy, our de-escalation policy and unprofessional conduct\". Earlier, Ms Jefferson's sister, Ashley Carr, said the victim had been \"killed by a reckless act\". Ms Carr called for a federal investigation. Lee Merritt, a civil rights lawyer who is representing the family, said: \"The investigation should be handled by someone other than the Fort Worth Police Department.\" He said the department was \"on track to be one of the deadliest police departments in the United States\". Accurate data on police shootings is difficult to obtain because local police forces are not obliged to provide figures. According to a database compiled by the Washington Post, 709 people have been killed by law enforcement officials so far this year and about 20% of victims were black. Texas had the second-highest number of total deaths. Candlelit protest Fort Worth residents held a protest outside Ms Jefferson's home on Sunday evening. First planned as a vigil, the gathering became a demonstration as residents demanded justice for the 28-year-old victim. Participants held candles and chanted: \"No justice, no peace.\" \"State sanctioned violence has always been a culture for black people,\" said protester Michelle Andersen. \"It's not about a training issue.\" Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price was present at the vigil, but left after she was approached by protesters shouting \"lock him up\", in reference to the officer, CBS News reported. What happened on Saturday? The shooting happened at about 02:30 local time (07:30 GMT). Body cam footage of the incident showed police searching the perimeter of Jefferson's property before noticing a figure at the window. After demanding that the person put their hands up, an officer then fired through the glass. Ms Jefferson had been playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew before she went to investigate the noise outside the window and was shot, said a lawyer representing her family. The officers involved did not park their marked cars in front of her house and did not identify themselves as police, officials said. Ms Jefferson's killing came two weeks after Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, 31, was found guilty of murdering 26-year-old Botham Jean. Guyger shot and killed Jean as he sat eating ice cream on his apartment sofa, less than 35 miles (55km) from Saturday's incident. Guyger testified that he mistakenly thought she was in her own flat and believed Jean to be an intruder. She addmitted at her trial that she had killed \"an innocent man\".", "summary1": "A US police officer who shot dead a black woman in her bedroom on Saturday has been charged with murder."}

His current wife Maesaiah Thabane has already been charged with the murder. He would be the first African leader to be charged with a domestic murder while in office, in a case that has shocked the tiny mountain kingdom. Lipolelo, 58, was shot dead two days before Mr Thabane became prime minister in 2017. At the time, he described her killing as \"senseless\" but police now accuse him of being involved in her killing. \"The prime minister is going to be charged with the murder,\" Deputy Commissioner of Police Paseka Mokete was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. \"The police are preparing directives and he will probably be charged tomorrow [Friday],\" he added. What does the prime minister say? Mr Thabane said on state radio that he had served the nation \"diligently\" and he would retire at the end of July, Reuters reports. \"I've worked for a peaceful and stable Lesotho. Today... at my age, I have lost most of my energy,\" he was quoted as saying. The ruling All Basotho Convention had given him a deadline of Thursday to resign. Constitutional crisis looms Lesotho's prime minister is not going down without a fight - his party, the All Basotho Convention (ABC) and its leadership, were expecting him to accept an ultimatum to step down ahead of the opening of parliament on Friday but he has refused. But it now looks highly unlikely that he will be appearing at parliament on Friday as planned. It's a desperate time for Mr Thabane, who has lost favour with his allies in this coalition government. He is now seen as a sinking ship and they do not want to go down with him. The prime minister is running out of time and room to manoeuvre - the country's police want him charged and hauled before a court, all by the end of this week. His arrest will not only be a great humiliation to the prime minister but could also plunge the country in a constitutional crisis - it's not every day that a sitting leader is charged with a crime. How did the murder take place? Lipolelo was gunned down at close range on the side of a dirt road while returning to her home in a small village on the outskirts of the capital, Maseru. She was involved in bitter divorce proceedings with Mr Thabane when she was killed. At the time, the prime minister was living with Maesaiah, 42, as if she were his wife. But Lipolelo had already won a separate legal battle to be recognised as first lady, as opposed to Maesaiah. Maesaiah accompanied Mr Thabane to his inauguration, following his estranged wife's death. Two months later she and Mr Thabane got married in a Catholic ceremony held at a packed stadium in Maseru. Maesaiah was charged with her rival's murder on 5 February, and is out on bail of about $67 (£52). She has also been charged with the attempted murder of a family friend Thato Sibolla, who was with Lipolelo at the time of the shooting and is expected to be a key witness in the murder case. Maesaiah has not yet been asked to enter a plea.", "summary1": "Lesotho's Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, 80, is to be charged with the murder of his estranged wife Lipolelo Thabane, police have said."}

Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer four years ago but had not made the information public. The news has left fans and the film world stunned. Get Out director Jordan Peele said it was \"a crushing blow\". \"A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much,\" his family said in the statement. \"From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and several more - all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honor of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther.\" Boseman came to prominence playing real-life figures - baseball great Jackie Robinson in 2013's 42, and soul singer James Brown in 2014's Get on Up. However, it will be as the titular Black Panther in the blockbuster 2018 film he will be best remembered. Boseman stars as the ruler of Wakanda, a fictional African nation with the most advanced technology on earth. As well as winning critical praise and taking more than $1.3 billion US dollars (£973m) at cinemas worldwide, the film was widely seen as a cultural milestone for having a largely black cast and a black director, Ryan Coogler. Boseman said last year that the film had changed what it means to be \"young, gifted and black\". Black Panther was the first superhero film to get a nomination for best picture at the Oscars. He also played the same role in other Marvel films Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. A sequel was in the works and due to come out in 2022, with Boseman set to return. The news of his death came as a shock to many as Boseman never discussed his diagnosis publicly. However, fans started raising concerns over his health this year due to noticeable weight loss. Tributes have already begun pouring in for the star, including from actor and fellow Marvel star Mark Ruffalo. Actor Dwayne Johnson tweeted: \"Thank you for shining your light and sharing your talent with the world. My love and strength to your family.\" Political figures have also started paying their respects, including Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Former President Barack Obama added his voice to the tributes, describing Boseman as \"blessed\" and praising his contribution. The hashtag #WakandaForever has also been trending. Born in South Carolina as the son of a nurse and an upholstery entrepreneur, Boseman graduated from Howard University in Washington DC.

Authorities made contact with 11 surviving miners a week after the blast, but one has since died. Rescuers have drilled small holes to supply food and medicine to the men. The cause of the explosion that sealed the mine entrance is still not known. The fate of another 11 miners trapped by the blast is unclear - authorities have been unable to communicate with them despite lowering food and messages into other areas of the mine. The group discovered alive told rescuers they had established communication with a lone miner about 100m below them, but had since lost touch with him. How will the rescue work? Currently, rescue operations are trying to widen a narrow shaft to make it big enough to lift the miners out. However, drilling is proving difficult as it needs to get through particularly hard granite and the miners are trapped far from the surface. Rescuers face an added problem in that the mine is waterlogged and there's the risk the chamber where the miners are stuck could flood. \"The obstacles are just too huge, which means we need a least another 15 days or even more to reach the miners,\" Gong Haitao, deputy head of the local publicity department, said. The debris standing in the way weighs about 70 tons, he added. How did they get trapped? The entry into the mine was severely damaged and communication was cut off by the so far unexplained explosion. For a week, there was no sign of life. Then, last Sunday, rescuers felt a pull on one of the ropes they were lowering into small shafts leading down into the dark. A paper note was then sent up on a rope from a group of 12 surviving miners - 11 trapped in one place and a 12th trapped further below. Since then, the contact with the 12th miner has been lost, while one of the group of 11, who had fallen into a coma after sustaining a head wound in the explosion, was on Thursday confirmed dead. Mining accidents are not uncommon in China, where the industry safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December last year, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. In September, 16 workers were killed at another mine on the outskirts of Chongqing, also due to carbon monoxide. In December 2019, an explosion at a coal mine in Guizhou province, south-west China, killed at least 14 people. How are the miners doing? The group of 10 known survivors are trapped in the dark some 600m (2,000ft) underground. They are in regular contact with the rescue teams. A communication line has been established and food and medicine can be lowered to them through a narrow shaft. While they've been receiving porridge and nutritional liquids, the miners a few days ago asked for a traditional meal of sausages. Eight of them are thought to be doing well, while two are in poor health.

Since then he has served as the UN special envoy for Syria, leading efforts to find a solution to the conflict. The career diplomat died in hospital in the Swiss city of Bern. He had been living near Geneva for several years. He \"passed away peacefully on Saturday after a short illness\", the Kofi Annan Foundation said. He was a \"deeply committed internationalist who fought throughout his life for a fairer and more peaceful world\", the statement added. Mr Guterres led the tributes to his predecessor. \"In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination,\" he said in a statement. UN high commissioner for human rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a tweet he was grief-stricken over Annan's death: Mr Obama, the first African American to win the White House, said: \"Long after he had broken barriers, Kofi never stopped his pursuit of a better world.\" President Putin said the memory of Annan would \"forever live in the hearts of Russians\". Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi said \"the world has lost not only a great African diplomat and humanitarian but also a conscience keeper of international peace and security\". Remembering Kofi Annan By Imogen Foulkes, BBC's UN reporter in Geneva Kofi Annan will be remembered for the way he drew attention, over and over again, to the plight of those caught up in war, environmental disaster, or simply grinding poverty. The way he quietly but firmly reminded world leaders, however powerful, that they needed to put their duty to their citizens above their political careers. Read more from Imogen UK PM Theresa May and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg were also among those who paid tributes. Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo announced a week of national mourning, calling Annan \"one of our greatest compatriots\". Kofi Annan described his greatest achievement as the Millennium Development Goals, which - for the first time - set global targets on issues such as poverty and child mortality. The drive is widely regarded as a success. However, Annan was not immune from criticism. Some blamed him for the UN's failure to halt the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s when he was head of the organisation's peacekeeping operations. He later clashed with America and the UK over the Iraq war after 2003, calling the US-led invasion illegal. But despite their past differences, former US President George W Bush was among those paying homage to Annan on Saturday, calling him \"a tireless leader of the United Nations\" whose \"voice of experience will be missed around the world\". After the invasion of Iraq, Annan and his son were accused of being involved in the \"oil for food corruption scandal\" that led some to call for his resignation, though he was later exonerated. The diplomat's career continued after retirement from the UN, and in 2007 he set up his own foundation aimed at promoting global sustainable development, security and peace. A year later, his reputation was boosted after he successfully helped negotiate a power-sharing deal to end post-election violence in Kenya. In a Facebook tribute, Raila Odinga, the opposition leader who signed the agreement, called Annan \"the man who stepped in and saved the country from collapse\". In an interview with the BBC's HardTalk to mark his 80th birthday in April, Annan acknowledged the UN's shortcomings, but said that \"if it didn't exist you would have to create it\". \"I was born an optimist and will remain an optimist,\" he added. In 2012 he was made chair of The Elders, a peace and human rights advocacy group started by South Africa's Nelson Mandela. The same year, he quit his post as UN envoy to Syria after only six months, citing the failures of world powers to fulfil their commitments. He was later quoted as saying: \"I lost my troops on the way to Damascus.\" His most recent role was chairing an independent commission investigating Myanmar's Rohingya crisis. Annan's wife, Nane, and three children were \"by his side during his last days\", the Kofi Annan Foundation said.", "summary1": "World figures have been paying tribute to former UN secretary-general and Nobel laureate Kofi Annan, who has died at the age of 80."}

But the office said it had determined Covid-19 \"was not manmade or genetically modified\". China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19. Since emerging in China last year, the virus has killed 230,000 people worldwide including 63,000 in the US. The pandemic has seen at least 3.2 million people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan. What did Trump say? At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: \"Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?\" \"Yes, I have. Yes, I have,\" said the president, without specifying. \"And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China.\" Asked later to clarify his comment, he said: \"I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that.\" He also told reporters: \"Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose? \"I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer.\" Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on, unnamed officials told NBC News. What did the intelligence service say? In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the \"wide scientific consensus\" regarding Covid-19's natural origins. \"The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\" It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon. What is the Wuhan lab? The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats. Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (£35m), the lab opened in 2015. Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon, Nature journal reports. It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world. What are Trump's accusations against China? Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing. On Wednesday, he suggested China wanted him to lose his re-election bid in November. He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body. China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations. How has Trump clashed with US intelligence before? In January, he called US intelligence agencies \"naive\" on Iran and dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign. He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despite US charges brought against Russian citizens. The right moment for this fight? President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead. Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight. China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game. Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.", "summary1": "US President Donald Trump has appeared to undercut his own intelligence agencies by suggesting he has seen evidence coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory."}

It was the second crash involving a Boeing 737 Max following the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia which killed all 189 people onboard. \"They are not trustworthy anymore - if they had been in the past,\" Ms Kuria said. She said the EASA's executive director Patrick Ky had reassured her that \"he would not be caving\" to either the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US regulator, or Boeing in terms of reclassifying whether the 737 Max is safe for European air travel. Boeing is hoping that the FAA will allow the Max back into the air in the early part of next year but the FAA's close relationship with Boeing has been under intense scrutiny.

Ms Kuria also said her safety concerns not only relate to the plane's automated flight control system which malfunctioned before both crashes but other critical safety systems on board the 737 Max. During the meeting, EASA said \"they would reassess all the critical safety systems that are on the 737 Max\", according to Ms Kuria.", "summary1": "Boeing is not a trustworthy company anymore, according to Zipporah Kuria, whose father was killed when a 737 Max plane crashed earlier this year."}

The \"passionate\" medic was \"always ready to go where people would need his help most,\" the WHO said in a tribute. The motive for the attack is unclear. More than 1,800 people have died from the Ebola virus in the past year. Efforts to contain the spread have been hindered by militia group violence and by suspicion towards foreign medical assistance. Senior military prosecutor Lt Col Jean-Baptiste Kumbu told AFP that militiamen involved in attacking treatment centres, including Butembo hospital, had under interrogation implicated four doctors in planning the raids. He said the three Congolese doctors will be prosecuted for \"terrorism\" and \"criminal conspiracy\", according to AFP, while the fourth doctor was still at large. The current outbreak in eastern DR Congo began in August last year and is the biggest of the 10 to hit the country since 1976, when the virus was first discovered. It is dwarfed by the West African epidemic of 2014-16, which affected 28,616 people mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,310 people died in what was the largest outbreak of the virus ever recorded. Dr Mouzoko was one of a number of medics deployed by the WHO to help fight the spread of the virus in DR Congo. Former colleagues in Madagascar, Cameroon and DR Congo have described Dr Mouzoko as a committed professional, who over the course of his career, helped train hundreds of young doctors and health workers. \"He would regularly spend 15 to 20 days a month working among isolated communities in his home country, Cameroon, far from his wife and 4 children,\" the WHO said in a statement after Dr Mouzoko's death. His funeral in April was attended by the global health body's top official and its Africa director. In a letter to the mayor of Butembo, a group representing local doctors said it was \"indignant\" over the arrests, adding that their absence would cripple vital medical services in the area such as blood transfusions and disease prevention. The group has threatened to strike within 48 hours unless the three detained doctors are released. But the military prosecutor dismissed their demands as \"out of the question\", AFP reports. Why are Ebola workers being attacked? About 200 health facilities have been attacked in DR Congo this year, forcing health workers to suspend or delay vaccinations and treatments. Reuters quotes Lt Col Kumbu as saying a total of 54 people are currently under arrest in connection with attacks on Ebola treatment centres. In February, medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) put its activities on hold in Butembo and Katwa - two eastern cities in the outbreak's epicentre. In North Kivu, community-based militia groups called Mai-Mai have been behind some of the attacks against health centres and workers. Another militia group, the Allied Defence Forces (Ugandan rebels operating within DR Congo) have also been accused of causing widespread disruption to medical units. There have also been a series of attacks by other unidentified groups on Ebola response centres. In one incident, family members assaulted health workers who were overseeing the burial of their relative in May. A 2018 study published in the Lancet medical journal says \"belief in misinformation was widespread\" concerning the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu. One in four respondents believed in the statement that Ebola does not exist, with an even higher proportion saying the Ebola outbreak was fabricated for financial gain, or to destabilise the region. \"There's already been civil unrest in the region and that's exacerbated when a foreign response comes into an area that's heavily guarded,\" says Lara Salahi, an author who has written about responses to Ebola outbreaks.", "summary1": "Three Congolese doctors have been arrested in the Democratic Republic of Congo over the killing of a World Health Organization (WHO) medic, a military prosecutor has said."}

The White House rejects the claims made in the book, and the Trump family unsuccessfully sued to block it. But it was released on 14 July after a judge sided with the publisher. 'More than narcissism' Ms Trump, 55, writes that for her uncle, \"nothing is ever enough\" and that the US president exhibits all the characteristics of a narcissist. \"This is far beyond garden-variety narcissism,\" his niece, who has a doctoral degree in clinical psychology, writes of Mr Trump. \"Donald is not simply weak, his ego is a fragile thing that must be bolstered every moment because he knows deep down that he is nothing of what he claims to be.\" She says the president was influenced by watching his father, Fred Trump Sr, bully her father Fred Trump Jr - who died from an alcohol related illness when she was 16 years old. Ms Trump writes that Trump Sr was extremely harsh to his oldest son, whom he wanted to take over the family real estate business. But as Ms Trump's father drifted away from the business, Trump Sr had no choice but to turn to his second son, Donald. It was not a happy choice, Ms Trump appears to claim. \"When things turned south in the late 1980s, Fred could no longer separate himself from his son's brutal ineptitude; the father had no choice but to stay invested,\" she writes of the senior Trump's attitude towards the future 45th US President. \"His monster had been set free.\" The White House rejected the claim that Mr Trump's father had been abrasive and harsh, saying that the president \"describes the relationship he had with his father as warm and said his father was very good to him\". 'I had to take Donald down' In the book, Ms Trump describes how she supplied tax documents to the New York Times, which used them to publish a 14,000 word investigative article into Mr Trump's \"dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents\". Ms Trump said she was approached by journalists at her home in 2017 and was initially reluctant to help. She waited for a month, watching as \"Donald shredded norms, endangered alliances, and trod upon the vulnerable,\" before deciding to contact the Times reporter. After smuggling 19 boxes of legal documents out of the law firm where they were kept, she handed them over to reporters. She describes hugging them and calls the moment \"the happiest I'd felt in months\". \"It wasn't enough for me to volunteer at an organisation helping Syrian refugees,\" she writes. \"I had to take Donald down.\" University 'cheater' Ms Trump claims that her uncle paid a friend to take the SAT test for him - a standardised exam which determines university placement - because he was \"worried that his grade point average, which put him far from the top of his class, would scuttle his efforts to get accepted\". He hired \"a smart kid with a reputation for being a good test taker, to take his SATs for him,\" she writes, adding: \"Donald, who never lacked for funds, paid his buddy well.\" Mr Trump attended Fordham University in New York City, but later transferred to the Wharton School of business at the University of Pennsylvania. The White House denied that the president cheated on the university entrance exam. Donald was 'destroyed' by his father Ms Trump blames the Trump family patriarch, Fred Trump Sr for much of the family's alleged dysfunction. She says Trump Sr, a New York City real estate mogul, \"destroyed\" Donald Trump by interfering in his \"ability to develop and experience the entire spectrum of human emotion\". \"By limiting Donald's access to his own feelings and rendering many of them unacceptable, Fred perverted his son's perception of the world and damaged his ability to live in it,\" she writes. \"Softness was unthinkable,\" for Trump Sr, she writes, adding that he would grow furious whenever her father - known as Freddy - apologised for any errors. Fred Sr, she said \"would mock him. Fred wanted his oldest son to be a 'killer.'\" Donald Trump, who is seven years younger than his late brother, \"had plenty of time to learn from watching Fred humiliate\" his eldest son, Ms Trump writes. \"The lesson he learned, at its simplest, was that it was wrong to be like Freddy: Fred didn't respect his oldest son, so neither would Donald.\" A problem with women Ms Trump writes that her uncle had asked her to ghost write a book about him, called the Art of the Comeback, and provided \"an aggrieved compendium of women he had expected to date but who, having refused him, were suddenly the worst, ugliest and fattest slobs he'd ever met\". He later had someone else fire her and never paid her for her work, she alleges. She says Mr Trump made suggestive comments about her body when she was 29 years old, even though she is his niece and Mr Trump was married to his second wife, Marla Maples. She says Mr Trump told his current wife Melania that his niece had dropped out of university and took drugs around the time he hired her for the book project. It is true that Ms Trump had left college, but she says she never took any drugs, and that she believes her uncle made up the story to present himself as her \"saviour\". \"The story was for his benefit as much as anybody else's,\" she writes, \"and by the time the doorbell rang, he probably already believed his version of events.\" Who is Mary Trump? Mary Trump, 55, is the daughter of Fred Trump Jr, the president's older brother, who died in 1981 at the age of 42. He struggled with alcoholism for much of his life and his premature death was caused by a heart attack linked to his drinking. President Trump has cited his brother's personal problems as spurring his administration's push for tackling the opioid addiction epidemic. In an interview last year with the Washington Post, Mr Trump said he regretted pressuring his older brother to join the family real estate business. Mary Trump has largely avoided the limelight since her uncle became president, though she has been critical of him in the past. After Mr Trump won the election in 2016, she described the experience as the \"worst night of my life,\" according to the Washington Post. \"We should be judged harshly,\" she tweeted. \"I grieve for our country.\"", "summary1": "A tell-all memoir written by President Donald Trump's niece claims that he is a \"narcissist\" who now threatens the life of every American."}

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Dr Robert Redfield and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Stephen Hahn are also self-isolating. In a statement, the CDC said Dr Redfield, 68, had no symptoms and was not feeling unwell, but would also be teleworking for two weeks after \"low risk exposure\" to someone at the White House. It is unclear who this person is. And an FDA spokesman told Reuters news agency on Friday that 60-year-old Stephen Hahn was also self-isolating. He has also tested negative, the spokesman said. The three men were due to address a Senate committee on Tuesday. Before the news about Dr Fauci became public, committee chairman Senator Lamar Alexander said Dr Redfield and Dr Hahn would be allowed to testify by videolink. What's the situation in the US?

It had estimated that between 200 and 300 were affected, but the true figure is 1,694, according to a letter it has since sent to a Plaid Cymru politician. The health board has apologised and said it was contacting the patients. Last week, Simon Dean, the health board's interim chief executive, told a Senedd committee discharging the patients was an \"error that should not have occurred\". He estimated then that between 200 and 300 people were affected but said his team was \"working through the precise number\". In a subsequent letter to Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth, a health board official has now confirmed 1,694 patients were wrongly discharged. People across north Wales were affected, rather than just Flintshire-based patients as initially thought. Mr ap Iorwerth said: \"One patient being discharged before time is one patient too many. \"To now learn that 1,694 patients were discharged early, while they still needed support from mental health services, is deeply distressing. \"I welcome the assurance that all 1,694 patients will be contacted in the coming days to be reinstated to this vital service, but the question remains as to how such a decision could have happened right across the health board area, and how there could have been such widespread 'misinterpretation' of guidance. \"It should have been pretty clear that this would be unacceptable. \"I think it's clear that immediate investment is needed in rebuilding mental health services.\" Mr Dean said the health board's primary mental health care service was \"receiving referrals as normal\". \"We will also be contacting all recently discharged patients to review the level of support they may need,\" he said. \"I would like to say how sorry I am for any distress that may have been caused.\" The Welsh Government, which placed the health board into \"special measures\" five years ago, said mental health services were \"essential\" during the pandemic. A spokesman added: \"While the way they're delivered might change because of the current restrictions, we expect health boards to maintain services. \"We are aware of correspondence discharging patients from local primary mental health services in north Wales during the pandemic. \"Although they were provided details for contacting crisis services, this is not in line with our guidance. \"The health board has assured us that all patients affected will be contacted by their local service.\"", "summary1": "Almost 1,700 mental health patients have been wrongly discharged from support services during the pandemic in north Wales."}

He was China's longest-serving wrongfully convicted inmate, after having served 9,778 days in the prison in Jiangxi province. Prosecutors who reopened the case said his confession had inconsistencies and did not match the original crime. He walked free after a high court found there was not enough evidence to justify his conviction. Observers say China is growing more willing to quash wrongful convictions, but only criminal not political. Footage on Chinese media showed Mr Zhang in an emotional reunion with his 83-year-old mother and his ex-wife following his release on Tuesday. China cracks down on forced confessions Analysis by Celia Hatton, BBC World Service Asia-Pacific editor It is an open secret in China that the police use various kinds of torture, including sleep deprivation, cigarette burns and beatings, to force suspects to confess to crimes. In the past, entire cases might then be pinned on that \"confession\". In 2010, a serious effort began in China's legal system to stamp out the use of forced confessions. Death sentences must now be approved by China's Supreme Court and there is a growing drive to eliminate cases that are pinned solely on a suspect's confession. However, China's legal reform has clear limits. Police in many provinces remain under heavy pressure to \"solve\" cases, often by producing suspects and there is little appetite to improve the treatment of dissidents and some ethnic minorities, including Muslim Uighurs. The authorities regularly detain individuals in politically sensitive cases and interrogate them outside of the normal detention system. Behind those closed doors, almost anything can happen. It is far more likely that China will reform its treatment of criminal suspects than those who appear to threaten the dominance of the Communist Party. His former wife, Song Xiaonyu, had two sons with Mr Zhang before they divorced 11 years ago. She remarried but continued to help her former husband with his appeal. \"I was so excited when I heard the court's announcement,\" said Ms Song. Mr Zhang was told by the court that he was entitled to compensation for wrongful conviction. \"I'll negotiate the exact amount of compensation with my client,\" Mr Zhang's lawyer, Wang Fei, told China Daily. \"We're also planning to ask for those who committed judicial miscarriages in the case to be held accountable.\" Mr Zhang's ordeal began in October 1993 when the bodies of two boys were discovered in a village reservoir in Jinxian, a county of Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi. Mr Zhang was a neighbour of the victims and was identified as a suspect and detained. In January 1995, a court in Nanchang found him guilty and sentenced him to death but allowed the sentence to be commuted to life imprisonment after he served two years. Mr Zhang said he was tortured by police during interrogations and continued to maintain his innocence. Despite this, his appeals were unsuccessful. Then, in March 2019 the high court agreed to retry the case and in July provincial prosecutors recommended Mr Zhang be acquitted based on insufficient evidence.

If the execution goes ahead, she will be the first female federal inmate to be put to death in almost 70 years. Montgomery's execution date was originally set for last month but a stay was put in place after her attorneys contracted Covid-19. It was then rescheduled for 12 January by the Justice Department. But Montgomery's lawyers argued that the date could not be set while a stay was in place. A court sided with her attorneys, stopping an order from the director of the Bureau of Prisons scheduling her death. But on Friday, a panel of judges concluded that the director had acted under the law, allowing the execution to take place. Montgomery's legal team said they will file a petition for the judges to reconsider their ruling. The last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year. If the remaining executions go ahead, Mr Trump will have overseen the most executions by a US president in more than a century. Montgomery's execution date is just days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Mr Biden, who for decades was a fierce supporter of the death penalty as a Delaware senator, has now said he will seek to end federal executions once he takes office. Who is Lisa Montgomery? In December 2004, Montgomery drove from Kansas to the home of Bobbie Jo Stinnett, in Missouri, purportedly to purchase a puppy, according to a Department of Justice press release. \"Once inside the residence, Montgomery attacked and strangled Stinnett - who was eight months pregnant - until the victim lost consciousness,\" it says. Montgomery cut into Stinnett's body to remove the baby, which she took with her in an attempt to pass it off as her own. In 2007, a jury found Montgomery guilty of federal kidnapping resulting in death, and unanimously recommended a death sentence. But Montgomery's lawyers say she experienced brain damage from beatings as a child and is mentally unwell, so should not face the death penalty. Federal and state executions - what's the difference? Under the US justice system, crimes can be tried either in federal courts, at a national level, or in state courts, at a regional level. Certain crimes, such as counterfeiting currency or mail theft, are automatically tried at a federal level, as are cases in which the US is a party or those which involve constitutional violations. The death penalty was outlawed at state and federal level by a 1972 Supreme Court decision that cancelled all existing death penalty statutes. A 1976 Supreme Court decision allowed states to reinstate the death penalty and in 1988 the government passed legislation that made it available again at federal level. According to data collected by the Death Penalty Information Center, 78 people were sentenced to death in federal cases between 1988 and 2018 but only three were executed.", "summary1": "A US appeals court has lifted a stay of execution on the only woman awaiting a federal death penalty."}

But as pictures and videos of Sophia began circulating on social media many started to ask why a robot already seemed to have secured more rights than women in the country. Sophia, created by Hong Kong company Hanson Robotics, addressed the audience in English without the customary headscarf and abaya, a traditional cloak which Saudi women are obliged to wear in public. \"I am very honoured and proud for this unique distinction,\" she said. \"This is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized with a citizenship.\" You may also like: Saudi users hailed the development using the Arabic hashtag #Robot_with_Saudi_nationality nearly 30,000 times in the first 24 hours since the announcement. But others took a more sarcastic tone. The Arabic hashtag #Sophia_calls_for_dropping_guardianship was also circulating, and has been used nearly 10,000 times to date. Under the Saudi guardianship system every woman must have a male companion with her in public, usually a close family member, who has authority to act on her behalf. \"Sophia has no guardian, doesn't wear an abaya or cover up - how come?\" commented one Twitter user. While another posted an image of the robot's face with a black headscarf and face veil drawn on, with the caption: \"How Sophia will look after a while\" But in addition to the posts comparing Sophia to Saudi women there was also discussion about the ease and speed in which she had been granted citizenship. Journalist Murtaza Hussain posted: \"This robot has gotten Saudi citizenship before kafala workers who have been living in the country their entire lives\" Under Saudi law, foreign workers can't leave the country without the permission of their employers - just one element of the Gulf system of kafala, which limits the rights of foreign workers. The Gulf Kingdom relies on hundreds of thousands of domestic workers from abroad. However there is a thriving black market in runaway migrant workers who have fled their employers, but find themselves unable to leave the country due to the country's exit visa law. \"A humanoid robot called Sophia got Saudi citizenship, while millions linger stateless,\" responded Lebanese-UK journalist Kareem Chahayeb. \"What a time to be alive.\" Saudi Arabia has been seeking to highlight a series of reforms being rolled out by the authorities in the Kingdom. Women were allowed to participate in Saudi Arabia's National Day and a longstanding ban on women driving was lifted in late September. The Kingdom is also seeking to diversify its economy beyond a reliance on oil, as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern over the government's strategy on Covid-19. The government has stopped publishing data on the number of coronavirus cases in the country. On 29 April, the last day official data was released, there were 509 cases, with 21 deaths in Tanzania. However, Mr Magufuli said last week that only four patients were receiving treatment in the largest city, Dar es Salaam. Last month, Tanzania's government dismissed a US embassy warning that hospitals in Dar es Salaam were \"overwhelmed\" and that the chances of contracting the virus was \"extremely high\". Mr Magufuli has repeatedly said the health crisis has been exaggerated and urged people to attend services in churches and mosques, saying that prayers \"can vanquish\" the virus. What did Magufuli say? \"I want to thank Tanzanians of all faiths. We have been praying and fasting for God to save us from the pandemic that has afflicted our country and the world. But God has answered us. \"I believe, and I'm certain that many Tanzanians believe, that the corona disease has been eliminated by God,\" he told worshippers on Sunday in Dodoma. His remarks were welcomed with applause and celebratory ululation. Mr Magufuli also commended the priest and worshippers for not wearing gloves and masks to protect themselves from the virus. What else has he said? He made similar comments last Friday during a teachers' conference, declaring \"corona is finished\". \"The health minister told me that we only have four patients in Dar es Salaam but this will not stop rumours to the contrary,\" he said. \"We need to be careful because some of these donations to fight coronavirus could be used to transmit the virus. \"I want to urge you Tanzanians not to accept donations of masks, instead tell the donors to go and use them with their wives and children,\" he added. The Tanzanian president is among several African leaders who have received orders for a herbal tonic touted by the president of Madagascar as a cure for Covid-19. It is unclear if it has been given to patients in Tanzania. There is no scientific proof that the tonic works and the WHO has urged people not to use unproven medication. Opposition politicians have criticised Mr Magufuli in the past for promoting policies that could harm the health of Tanzanians. The head of Tanzania's medical association, Elisha Osati, backed the government in a recent BBC interview, saying that hospitals were operating as normal and that the majority of coronavirus inpatients were suffering from mild symptoms. Mr Magufuli has accused the country's health officials of exaggerating the coronavirus crisis. He has also ridiculed the strict measures neighbouring countries have imposed to fight the pandemic.", "summary1": "Tanzania's President John Magufuli has declared the country \"coronavirus-free\" thanks to prayers by citizens."}

Nusrat, who was 19, was from Feni, a small town 100 miles (160km) south of Dhaka. She was studying at a madrassa, or Islamic school. On 27 March, she said the headmaster called her into his office and repeatedly touched her in an inappropriate manner. Before things could go any further she ran out. Many girls and young women in Bangladesh choose to keep their experiences of sexual harassment or abuse secret for fear of being shamed by society or their families. What made Nusrat Jahan different is that she didn't just speak out - she went to the police with the help of her family on the day the alleged abuse happened. At the local police station she gave a statement. She should have been provided with a safe environment to recall her traumatic experiences. Instead she was filmed by the officer in charge on his phone as she described the ordeal. In the video Nusrat is visibly distressed and tries to hide her face with her hands. The policeman is heard calling the complaint \"no big deal\" and telling her to move her hands from her face. The video was later leaked to local media. 'I tried to take her to school' Nusrat Jahan Rafi was from a small town, came from a conservative family, and went to a religious school. For a girl in her position, reporting sexual harassment can come with consequences. Victims often face judgement from their communities, harassment, in person and online, and in some cases violent attacks. Nusrat went on to experience all of these. On 27 March, after she went to the police, they arrested the headmaster. Things then got worse for Nusrat. A group of people gathered in the streets demanding his release. The protest had been arranged by two male students and local politicians were allegedly in attendance. People began to blame Nusrat. Her family say they started to worry about her safety. Nevertheless, on 6 April, 11 days after the alleged sexual assault, Nusrat went to her school to sit her final exams. \"I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn't allowed to enter,\" said Nusrat's brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman. \"If I hadn't been stopped, something like this wouldn't have happened to my sister,\" he said. According to a statement given by Nusrat, a fellow female student took her to the roof of the school, saying one of her friends was being beaten up. When Nusrat reached the rooftop four or five people, wearing burqas, surrounded her and allegedly pressured her to withdraw the case against the headmaster. When she refused, they set her on fire. Police Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder said the killers wanted \"to make it look like a suicide\". Their plan failed when Nusrat was rescued after they fled the scene. She was able to give a statement before she died. \"One of the killers was holding her head down with his hands, so kerosene wasn't poured there and that's why her head wasn't burned,\" Mr Majumder told BBC Bengali. But when Nusrat was taken to a local hospital, doctors found burns covering 80% of her body. Unable to treat the burns, they sent her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. In the ambulance, fearing she might not survive, she recorded a statement on her brother's mobile phone. \"The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath,\" you can hear her say. She also identified some of her attackers as students at the madrassa. News of Nusrat's health dominated Bangladeshi media. On 10 April, she died. Thousands of people turned out for her funeral in Feni. Police have since arrested 15 people, seven of them allegedly involved in the murder. Among those arrested are the two male students who organised the protest in support of the headmaster. The headmaster himself remains in custody. The policeman who filmed Nusrat's sexual harassment complaint has been removed from his post and transferred to another department. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met Nusrat's family in Dhaka and promised that every person involved in the killing would be brought to justice. \"None of the culprits will be spared from legal action,\" she said. Nusrat's death has sparked protests and thousands have used social media to express their anger about both her case and the treatment of sexual assault victims in Bangladesh. \"Many girls don't protest out of fear after such incidents. Burqas, even dresses made of iron cannot stop rapists,\" said Anowar Sheikh on BBC Bengali's Facebook page. \"I wanted a daughter my whole life, but now I am afraid. Giving birth to a daughter in this country means a life of fear and worry,\" wrote Lopa Hossain in her Facebook post. According to women's rights group Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, there were 940 incidents of rape in Bangladesh in 2018. But researchers say the real number is likely to be much higher. \"When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from police to properly investigate the allegations,\" said Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers' Association. \"It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice. Ultimately the criminals don't get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don't fear to do the same because of such examples.\" Now people are asking: Why did Nusrat's case only get attention after she was attacked? And will her case change the way people view sexual harassment in Bangladesh? In 2009, the country's Supreme Court passed an order to establish sexual harassment cells in all educational institutions where students can take their complaints, but very few schools have taken up the initiative. Activists are now demanding the order be implemented and enshrined in law to protect students. \"This incident has shaken us, but as we have seen in the past, such incidents get forgotten in time. I don't think there will be a big change after this. We have to see if justice gets done,\" said Professor Kaberi Gayen of the University of Dhaka. \"Change has to come in, both psychologically and in implementing the rule of law. Awareness about sexual harassment should be raised from childhood in schools,\" she said. \"They have to learn what is right and wrong when it comes to sexual harassment.\"", "summary1": "Nusrat Jahan Rafi was doused with kerosene and set on fire at her school in Bangladesh. Less than two weeks earlier, she had filed a sexual harassment complaint against her headmaster."}

Coronaviruses are a family of virus that most usually cause mild illness such as the common cold. And all of them, including the pandemic one, can be killed by soap and water. Each winter the Medical Research Council asks people in England whether they have flu-like respiratory symptoms and tests those who do for common cold coronavirus infections. And the study, published in Wellcome Open Research and awaiting peer review, found the 1,663 participants were much less likely to be infected if they washed their hands at least six times a day. Hand-washing more than 10 times a day did not appear to cut the risk of infection further, however. Study author Dr Sarah Beale, from University College London, said: \"Good hand hygiene should be practised at all times regardless of whether you show symptoms or not. \"This will help protect yourself and prevent unwittingly spreading the virus to others around you.\" A Public Health England official said: \"Regular hand-washing for at least 20 seconds is one of the best ways of stopping the spread of coronavirus, particularly after you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, as well as before eating or cooking. \"Also, it's a good idea to get into the habit after you've been out in public places or on transport.\"", "summary1": "Washing your hands at least six to 10 times a day makes catching infections such as coronavirus much less likely, a study by UK researchers suggests."}

Brad Pitt gets political Pitt won the first acting Oscar of his career - picking up the best supporting actor trophy for his role in Quentin Tarantino's film. He was the first winner of the night, and immediately used his speech to attack the way the impeachment proceedings against US President Donald Trump were handled. He referred to the fact that Republican senators voted against allowing witnesses including former National Security Adviser John Bolton to give evidence. \"They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week,\" he said. \"I'm thinking maybe Quentin does a movie about it and in the end the adults do the right thing.\" The 56-year-old moved from the political to the personal, paying tribute to co-star Leonardo DiCaprio and reflecting on his journey to Hollywood superstardom. \"I'm a bit gobsmacked,\" he said, getting emotional. \"I'm not one to look back, but this has made me do so.\" Joaquin Phoenix: 'I've been a scoundrel' Phoenix, who won best actor for his remarkable performance in the origin story about Batman's nemesis, also used the podium to send a heartfelt message about the state of the world, saying actors have the power to give a \"voice for the voiceless\". After telling the audience to stop clapping him as he took to the stage - \"Don't do that\" - he managed to cover topics from animal rights and the environment to racism and sexism. The vegan activist told the audience that \"we feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable\". He also pointed out his own flaws: \"I've been a scoundrel in my life. I've been cruel at times and hard to work with, but so many people in this room have given me a second chance.\" He ended his speech by quoting a lyric written by his late brother River: \"Run to the rescue and love and peace will follow.\" The biggest winners Laura Dern's 'best birthday present ever' A day before her 53rd birthday, Laura Dern won best supporting actress for playing a divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. She comes from an illustrious acting family, but in winning managed something her parents have not. Mother Diane Ladd has been nominated for three Academy Awards, and dad Bruce Dern has two unsuccessful nominations. \"Some say never meet your heroes,\" their daughter told the audience. \"But I say if you're really blessed, you get them as your parents.\" Meanwhile, Zellweger used her speech to pay tribute to Garland, who was nominated for two Oscars in the 1950s and 60s. \"Judy Garland did not receive this honour in her time,\" the actress said. \"I am certain that this moment is an extension of the celebration of her legacy.\" The British winners Other notable winners And some notable omissions No host (but two hosts) For the second year, the ceremony had no host. It all started with an incendiary performance by singer and Moonlight actress Janelle Monae. \"We are celebrating all the women who directed phenomenal films,\" she said. \"I'm proud to be here as a black queer woman.\" Then Steve Martin and Chris Rock appeared to deliver the traditional opening monologue as a double act. \"We both have hosted the Oscars before. And this is such an incredible demotion,\" Martin quipped. He remarked: \"Think how much the Oscars have changed in the past 92 years. Back in 1929 there were no black acting nominees.\" Rock added: \"And now in 2020 we've got one.\" They then gave way to a string of other celebrities to introduce each award.

Dr Mukwege is a Congolese gynaecologist who, along with his colleagues, has treated tens of thousands of victims. Some 331 individuals and organisations were nominated for the prestigious peace award this year. The winners announced in the Norwegian capital Oslo on Friday won the award for their \"efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war\", Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Nobel committee chair, said. The pair both made a \"crucial contribution to focusing attention on, and combating, such war crimes\", Ms Reiss-Andersen added. How have the winners reacted? Ms Murad, 25, said in a statement that many Yazidis would \"look upon this prize and think of family members that were lost, are still unaccounted for, and of the 1,300 women and children, which remain in captivity\". \"For myself, I think of my mother, who was murdered by DAESH [IS], the children with whom I grew up, and what we must do to honour them,\" she added. \"Persecution of minorities must end. We must work together with determination - to prove that genocidal campaigns will not only fail, but lead to accountability for the perpetrators and justice for the survivors.\" New Iraqi President Barham Saleh called the award \"an honour for all Iraqis who fought terrorism and bigotry\". Dr Mukwege was operating at his hospital when he heard he had won the prize. \"I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around [it] I wasn't really thinking about what was going on, and suddenly some people came in and told me the news,\" he told Norwegian newspaper VG. He dedicated his award to all women affected by sexual violence. \"This Nobel prize is a recognition of the suffering and the failure to adequately compensate women who are victims of rape and sexual violence in all countries around the world,\" he told reporters gathered outside his clinic. Who is Nadia Murad? Ms Murad did not just lose her mother in the genocide. She endured three months as a sex slave at the hands of IS militants. She was bought and sold several times and subjected to sexual and physical abuse during her captivity. After escaping, she became an activist for the Yazidi people, campaigning to help put an end to human trafficking and calling on the world to take a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. Ms Murad described her escape in a BBC interview in 2016, detailing how the women who were held captive were treated by IS. She was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Council of Europe in 2016 and called for an international court to judge crimes committed by IS in her acceptance speech in Strasbourg. Ms Murad, the first Iraqi to win the award, was named the UN's first goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking later that year. Who is Denis Mukwege? He has spent decades helping rape victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He and his colleagues are said to have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious injuries sustained during sex assaults that were carried out as a weapon of war. The 63-year-old has won a number of international prizes, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize, and was named African of the Year in 2009. He lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital and has also previously called for a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. Denis Mukwege in his own words It was in 1999 that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. I thought that was a barbaric act of war but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: \"People came into my village and raped me, tortured me.\" Other women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped, chemicals had been poured on their genitals. I started to ask myself what was going on. These weren't just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch. The result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It's very effective. Who else won a Nobel award this year? Earlier this week the Nobel prize for physics was awarded to Donna Strickland, only the third woman winner of the award and the first in 55 years. The Canadian was honoured along with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. The Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to two scientists - Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan - who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system. For chemistry, the prize was awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research. Americans Frances Arnold and George P Smith shared the prize with Briton Gregory Winter How is the prize decided?", "summary1": "The 2018 Nobel Peace Prize has gone to campaigners against rape in warfare, Nadia Murad and Denis Mukwege."}

His family has called for an independent investigation, after footage of the incident went viral. Victoria Police said an internal unit was investigating. Melbourne has been under a strict coronavirus lockdown for the past two months. Police have been given unprecedented powers, under public health orders, to fine and detain people, but it does not appear that Sunday's arrest was related to a lockdown breach. The man had been at a hospital seeking treatment for mental health issues when he left, prompting staff to call the police. A video of the arrest taken by a bystander shows a policeman appearing to stomp on the man's head before officers pin him to the ground. Victoria Police said the man had been behaving erratically and assaulted an officer. What does the video show? Footage broadcast by the Seven News TV channel shows the man walking in the middle of the road, waving his arms in front of a police car. The man turns his back and walks away slowly, before being hit by the police car from behind. In another video, taken several minutes later, an officer stands over the man and appears to kick down on his head to prevent him from getting up. He and five other officers then pin him down. What did the man's family say? His father has accused the officers of using excessive force. \"It is like watching a video from America or Beirut,\" he told the Herald Sun newspaper. \"Police are not above the law - they should be held accountable. They were kicking him and he wasn't even fighting back. It was extremely excessive.\" The man's lawyer, Jeremy King, told ABC News that his client had not committed a crime and was in a \"vulnerable\" state at the time of his arrest. \"Really he's a person that the police should be dealing with in a very unique way,\" Mr King said. What did authorities say? Victoria Police said its officers were called to reports of a man behaving erratically in the suburb of Epping at about 16:10 (06:10 GMT) on Sunday. \"During the highly dynamic incident a police officer was assaulted and [pepper spray] was deployed before the man was arrested and subsequently taken to hospital for assessment,\" a police spokesperson said on Monday. \"Upon arrival the male allegedly became aggressive and damaged a police vehicle while attempting to avoid arrest.\" You may also be interested in: State Police Minister Lisa Neville said body-camera footage of the arrest would be reviewed by Victoria Police' Professional Standards Command, which oversees the conduct of the state's police officers. Ms Neville said the officers were in \"difficult circumstances\", but added there were \"concerning aspects of the arrest, particularly at the end\". Have there been other police controversies? Since Melbourne's lockdown began on 9 July, stay-at-home rules have been enforced by a heavy police presence. Some incidents have sparked public anger. Earlier this month, the arrest of a pregnant woman in her home for promoting an anti-lockdown protest on social media drew much criticism. Social media videos have also captured other confrontations. In turn, Victoria Police has said it has faced a rise in aggressive and violent behaviour from people opposed to lockdown. Police have also faced greater scrutiny in the wake of the global Black Lives Matter movement.

She spoke out amid fears over the spread of Covid-19 in Belmarsh Prison. He has been held there since being dragged from the Ecuadorean embassy a year ago. The 48-year-old Australian is now seeking bail amid concerns over his health. Ms Morris, a South African-born lawyer, told The Mail on Sunday she was revealing their union for the first time because his \"life is on the brink\" and she did not believe he would \"survive infection with coronavirus\". In a video posted on Wikileaks' YouTube account, she says she met Assange in 2011 when she joined his legal team. He took refuge in the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has since been dropped. He is also fighting extradition to the United States on espionage charges. Ms Morris says she visited him in the embassy almost every day and \"got to know Julian very well\". The couple fell in love in 2015 and got engaged two years later. She told the Mail on Sunday that Assange had watched both boys being born via video link and they had visited their father at the embassy. Three-year-old Gabriel and one-year-old Max speak to their father via video calls, she says. \"Forming a family was a deliberate decision to break down those walls around him and imagine a life beyond that prison,\" she says in the Wikileaks YouTube video. \"While for many people it would seem insane to start a family in that context, for us it was the sane thing to do, to keep things real. \"It grounds me, and when Julian sees the children, it gives him a lot of peace and nurture and support. They are very happy children.\" Assange was arrested on 11 April 2019 at the Ecuadorean embassy and detained for \"failing to surrender to the court\". He was sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. Assange was due to be released from HMP Belmarsh last September after serving the custody period of his jail term. But a judge ruled that he should remain in jail until his extradition hearing because of his \"history of absconding\". Details about the children with Stella Morris were seen by the Mail in court documents as part of his US extradition case. Assange is believed to have other children, although little is known about them. He has an adult son, Daniel Assange, who is reportedly a software designer in Australia. More than a thousand UK prisoners have reported symptoms of coronavirus, official figures show. One inmate at HMP Belmarsh is among several to have have died, according to internal data confirmed by the Ministry of Justice. Up to 4,000 low-risk prisoners in England and Wales are to be released in an effort to control the spread of the coronavirus, the government has said.", "summary1": "Julian Assange secretly fathered two children while living inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London, his partner has revealed."}

He was suffering from a fever, a dry cough, and flu-like symptoms. When he became ill he thought of his time as a child in Cameroon when he contracted malaria. He feared the worse. \"When I was going to the hospital for the first time I was thinking about my death and how I thought it was going to happen,\" he said. For 13 days he remained in isolation in a local Chinese hospital. He was treated with antibiotics and drugs typically used to treat HIV patients. After two weeks of care he began to show signs of recovery. The CT scan showed no trace of the illness. He became the first African person known to be infected with the deadly coronavirus and the first to recover. His medical care was covered by the Chinese state. Egypt has become the first country in Africa to confirm a case of the coronavirus. Health professionals warn that countries with weaker health systems may struggle to cope with a potential outbreak of the illness, which has led to more than 1,770 deaths and infected more than 72,000 people, mostly in China. \"I don't want to go home before finishing studying. I think there is no need to return home because all hospital fees were taken care of by the Chinese government,\" says Mr Senou. To evacuate or not? Since late January governments around the world, led by the US, began evacuating their citizens out of Wuhan and neighbouring cities. But thousands of African students, workers and families, remain in lockdown across the central Hubei province - the outbreak began in the provincial capital Wuhan - and some think their governments should do more to help them. \"We are sons and daughters of Africa but Africa is not willing to come to our rescue when we need it the most,\" says Tisiliyani Salima, a medical student at Tongji Medical University and president of the Zambian Wuhan student association. Learn more about the new virus For close to a month Ms Salima has been living in self-quarantine. Time has begun to lose meaning for the 24-year old student. She spends her days sleeping and checking updates on Chinese social media apps. She acts as the liaison between her embassy and the 186 Zambian students living under quarantine in Wuhan. Many worry about food safety, supplies, and lack information in a city that this week has seen an average of 100 deaths a day. She watched other international classmates evacuated from the city while her countrymen and women were left behind. \"South of the Sahara most African countries have had a similar response,\" says one student who agreed to talk under the condition of anonymity. \"Publicly or privately African countries say that China can handle the situation. But the situation is not under control. When you listen to the official response it tells you that the African countries do not want to offend China. We don't have the bargaining power,\" the student says. China is currently Africa's largest trading partner and the ties between the two have blossomed in recent years. In the process China has become home to 80,000 African students, many attracted to the middle kingdom by scholarship programmes. But community leaders say families, young and old are stranded in Hubei province with little aid or assistance from their governments. \"People are saying: 'Don't bring us back because Nigeria can't handle us.' I feel conflicted but at the end of the day I am also human,\" says Angela, a recent graduate from Nigeria, who only gave her first name. \"I would appreciate if they would recognise that there are Nigerians here but we don't seem to be a priority. We didn't get any response from our government,\" she says. Last week, for the first time in 22 days in lockdown, dwindling supplies forced Angela to venture out of her apartment to buy some essentials. \"The city is like a ghost town. When I left my complex I didn't know if I would even be allowed back in. People are checking temperatures outside the gate,\" she says in a phone interview from her apartment. On 30 January the Cameroonian community penned an open letter to the president urging their government to evacuate citizens stuck in the epicentre of the outbreak. Weeks on Dr Pisso Scott Nseke, a community leader in Wuhan, says Cameroonians are still waiting for a response. He accepts that the community is not united in the desire to be evacuated but says they are disappointed by the lack of assistance from the government. As of mid-February, Egypt, Algeria, Mauritius, Morocco and Seychelles had moved their citizens out of Hubei province. Other nations such as Ghana and Kenya are reportedly considering evacuating. 'We feel abandoned' Some nations have sent financial support to their citizens. According to the head of the Ivory Coast student association in Wuhan $490 ($380) was given to the 77 Ivoirians in the city following weeks of discussions with their government. But many are growing increasingly frustrated by their government's stance. Ghana has reportedly sent financial assistance to its nationals as well. \"Staying here doesn't guarantee our safety. We are just in a country that has better medical facilities,\" says Ms Salima. \"We feel abandoned. The Chinese clearly were angered by the Americans pulling their people out as they felt it caused panic,\" said one student who agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity. \"There is a lot of distrust here of the authorities,\" he added. Some are calling for a continent-wide strategy to help African nationals in China. \"The decision to evacuate is not a question of 'solidarity' with China or the lack of it. It is the responsibility of every country to ultimately look after the health of their citizens wherever they are, including in China,\" says Hannah Ryder from Development Reimagined, a Beijing-based international development consultancy. As for Mr Senou, he says has no plans to return to Cameroon. \"It would be a bad and dangerous idea. The biggest fear I had from the virus was psychological and emotional. Going back home is not an option now.\"", "summary1": "When Kem Senou Pavel Daryl, a 21-year-old Cameroonian student living in the Chinese city of Jingzhou, contracted the coronavirus he had no intention of leaving China, even if that were possible."}

Det Insp Jess Milne, said: \"The piece of art that has been stolen is a high-value toilet made out of gold that was on display at the palace. \"We believe a group of offenders used at least two vehicles during the offence. \"The artwork has not been recovered at this time but we are conducting a thorough investigation to find it and bring those responsible to justice.\" In a tweet, Blenheim Palace said it would remain shut for the rest of the day, but would reopen on Sunday. Palace chief executive Dominic Hare said they were \"saddened by this extraordinary event, but also relieved no-one was hurt\". \"We hope that the wonderful work of our dear friend Maurizio Cattelan becomes immortalised by this stupid and pointless act,\" he added. The gold toilet was famously offered to US President Donald Trump in 2017. The arrested man is in police custody.", "summary1": "An 18-carat solid gold toilet has been stolen in a burglary overnight at Blenheim Palace."}

That might come as a surprise as feminism - the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of equality of the sexes - has been in the spotlight lately. A day after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, millions around the world joined the 2017 Women's March. A key aim was to highlight women's rights, which many believed to be under threat. Another defining moment came when sexual harassment claims were made against film producer Harvey Weinstein by more than 80 women - allegations he denies. Online movements have also gained momentum. Actress Alyssa Milano suggested that anyone who had been \"sexually harassed or assaulted\" should reply to her Tweet with \"#MeToo\", resurrrecting a movement started by activist Tarana Burke in 2006. Half a million responded in the first 24 hours and the hashtag has been used in more than 80 countries. Many other celebrities have publicly embraced feminism, including actresses Emma Watson, who launched an equality campaign with the United Nations and \"body positivity warrior\" Jameela Jamil. Movements like #everydaysexism and discussion points such as author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Ted talk, We should all be feminists, have also struck a chord with millions. Rejection of feminism These events have all helped to bring feminism to mainstream attention. So it is perhaps unexpected that the identity \"feminist\" has not gained more popularity among young women in the Western world. In the UK there has been a small increase in the number of women who identify as such. A 2018 YouGov poll found that 34% of women in the UK said \"yes\" when asked whether they were a feminist, up from 27% in 2013. It's a similar picture in Europe, with fewer than half of men and women polled in five countries agreeing they were a feminist. This ranged from 8% of respondents in Germany, to 40% in Sweden. However, people do not appear to reject the term feminism because they are against gender equality or believe it has been achieved. The same study found that eight out of 10 people said men and women should be treated equally in every way, with many agreeing sexism is still an issue. This appears to represent a shift in attitudes over time. A study of 27,000 people in the US found that two-thirds believed in gender equality in 2016, up from a quarter in 1977. And in a 2017 UK poll, 8% said they agreed with traditional gender roles - that a man should earn money and a woman should stay at home - down from 43% in 1984. If many believe gender equality is important, and still lacking, then why do relatively few people - including young women - identify as feminist? It could be that they do not feel the term speaks to them. The term feminist is less likely to appeal to working-class women, polls suggest. Almost one in three people from the top social grade ABC1 - those in managerial, administrative and professional occupations - called themselves a feminist in a 2018 poll. This compared with one in five from grades C2DE, which include manual workers, state pensioners, casual workers, and the unemployed. But those from lower income backgrounds are just as likely to support equal rights. Eight out of 10 people from both groups agreed men and women should be equal in every way, when asked for a 2015 poll. This may suggest lower income groups support the principle behind feminism, but aren't keen on the word itself. Race can also shape views of feminism. Research into the views of US millennials found 12% of Hispanic women, 21% of African American women, 23% of Asian women and 26% of white women identify as a feminist. Three-quarters of all the women polled said the feminist movement has done either \"a lot\" or \"some\" to improve the lives of white women. However, just 60% said it had achieved much for women of other ethnicities - a sentiment shared by 46% of African American women. Battling stereotypes Another hurdle may be some of the stereotypes and misconceptions associated with feminism. In her introduction to the recently published anthology Feminists Don't Wear Pink and Other Lies, curator Scarlett Curtis refers to the stereotype of feminists as not wearing make-up, or shaving their legs or liking boys. These stereotypes have persisted through the ages. In the 1920s, feminists were often called spinsters and speculation about their sexual preferences was rife. Almost a century later, these views still hold some sway. More stories like this Having interviewed a diverse group of young German and British women for my research, I found associations of the term \"feminism\" with man-hating, lesbianism or lack of femininity was a key factor in rejections of the label \"feminist\". The majority said they did not want to call themselves feminist because they feared they would be associated with these traits. This was despite many stressing they were not homophobic and some identifying as lesbian or bisexual. So, how could the image of feminism be improved? Arguably, as a society we should do more to challenge narrowly defined expectations of how women should look and act. Working harder to make this movement more inclusive could mean that feminism speaks to the experiences and concerns of diverse groups of women. Nevertheless, whichever label women choose to adopt, the indication that the vast majority of people now support equality - and acknowledge it has not yet been achieved - is heartening.

The verdict for what was ruled to be a crime against humanity was heard in a packed courtroom in Kavumu, in South Kivu in the east of the country. A military tribunal ruled that the men from the Djeshi ya Yesu (Army of Jesus) militia should be \"sentenced to life in prison for the crime against humanity by rape and murder\". The men were also convicted of murder, membership in a rebel movement and illegal weapons possession. A total of 18 had been tried but two were sentenced to just one year in jail, while five were acquitted. Many of the assaults happened at night. The men were alleged to believe that the blood of virgins would grant them supernatural protection. Gynaecologist Denis Mukwege, who has developed expertise in the treatment of serious sexual injuries in the DR Congo where rape is used as a weapon of war, reported a wave of incidents to the authorities in 2015.

One UN official resigned out of frustration at the UN's continued failure to halt the atrocities in Kavumu, according to a Guardian report in 2016.

It comes amid escalating political tensions between the two countries. The image referred to alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers - murders of Afghan civilians and prisoners. Warning: This story contains an image some people might find distressing. Earlier this month, a report found \"credible information\" that 25 Australian soldiers were involved in the murders of 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners between 2009 and 2013. The findings from the Australian Defence Force (ADF) inquiry sparked widespread condemnation, and are now being investigated by police. What exactly did China put online? On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao posted a fabricated image which portrayed an Australian soldier with a bloody knife next to a child. The child is seen holding a lamb. The image appears to be a reference to previously reported allegations that elite Australian soldiers used knives to murder two 14-year-old Afghan boys. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported the ADF report did not substantiate those allegations. However it did find \"credible evidence\" of unlawful killings and a \"warrior culture\" within elite units. The allegations included that junior soldiers were encouraged to shoot prisoners for their first kill. Mr Zhao's tweet said: \"Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, and call for holding them accountable.\" How did Australia respond? Australia has requested Twitter remove the post from its platform, describing it as \"disinformation\". Mr Morrison described the post as \"truly repugnant, deeply offensive, utterly outrageous\". \"The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes,\" he said. \"It is a false image and terrible slur on our defence forces.\" He added that Australia had established a transparent process to investigate the alleged war crimes, as was expected of a \"democratic, liberal\" country. Mr Morrison went on to acknowledge that there are \"undoubtedly\" tensions between the two nations, but said: \"This is not how you deal with it.\" He warned Beijing that other countries around the world were watching its actions towards Australia. This is a new low in an already very tense relationship between the two key trading partners. Last week, Mr Zhao said the war crimes' report \"fully exposed the hypocrisy of the human rights and freedom these Western countries are always chanting\". But his tweet shocked Scott Morrison into his most undiplomatic language yet. It's another indication of how bad things have become between Canberra and Beijing. The Australian prime minister acknowledged that the two countries have had their problems but this tweet, he said, had gone too far. This comes at a very sensitive time for Australia. The country and its military are reeling from the findings of the war crimes inquiry - 19 Special Air Service (SAS) troops could face prosecution for the murders. For China to use this against Australia is one thing, but a senior Chinese official doing so accompanied by a fake inflammatory image has clearly pushed the Morrison government over the edge. Australian exporters are on tenterhooks about what other tariffs they can expect from China amid the escalating spat. There's a lot at stake here: crucial diplomatic relations and billions of dollars' worth of trade. Both sides know that but it seems that only Australia, despite its fury, is still willing to extend a hand. It's worth noting that in his angry comments today, Mr Morrison still left room for diplomatic manoeuvre. \"Despite this terribly offensive post today, I would ask again and call on China to re-engage in that dialogue,\" he said, adding that he hoped this \"awful\" event would lead to a type of \"reset\". But China is unrepentant. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: \"It's not China which should be ashamed, but Australia.\" Why are China-Australia relations so bad? Bilateral relations between the two countries have rapidly deteriorated this year after Australia led calls for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, and ongoing discussion about Beijing's alleged interference in Australian affairs. In recent months, China has imposed a series of economic blows - including trade stoppages and tariffs - on about a dozen Australian imports including wine, barley and beef. Australia has described China's actions as \"economic coercion\". Earlier this month, China's embassy in Australia circulated a list to local media outlining 14 policy areas where it said Australia had acted in a way that aggravated relations. These included Australia's decision to block Chinese investment projects, ban Chinese tech firm Huawei from its 5G tender, and \"incessant wanton interference in China's Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs\". Australia has said it will not change its policy positions. On Monday, Mr Morrison confirmed that Australia's requests for meetings with senior Chinese ministers continued to be rebuffed.", "summary1": "Australia has demanded China apologise for posting a fake picture on a government Twitter account that depicted an Australian soldier murdering an Afghan child."}

Mr Assange, who is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011, says the case is politically motivated. Expressing disappointment at the ruling, the US justice department noted that its legal arguments had prevailed. Its position is that the leaks broke the law and endangered lives. \"While we are extremely disappointed in the court's ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised,\" the justice department said. The US authorities have 14 days in which to lodge an appeal and are expected to do so. Mr Assange will now be taken back to Belmarsh Prison - where he is being held - and a full application for his bail will be made on Wednesday. His lawyer Ed Fitzgerald QC told the court there would be evidence to show Mr Assange would not abscond. What did the judge say? District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that while US prosecutors had met the tests for Mr Assange to be extradited for trial, the US was incapable of preventing him from attempting to take his own life. Outlining evidence of his self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she said: \"The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future.\" She said: \"Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge.\" Mr Assange, who wore a blue suit and green face mask in the dock, closed his eyes as the judge read out her ruling on Monday. His fiancee Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept and was comforted by Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson, who sat next to her in court. Speaking outside court after the ruling, she called on the US president to \"end this now\". \"Mr President, tear down these prison walls,\" she said. \"Let our little boys have their father. Free Julian, free the press, free us all.\" District Judge Vanessa Baraitser explicitly concluded that Mr Assange should answer allegations that he aided and abetted hacking, theft and the disclosure of the identities of informants working for the US security agencies - disclosures that endangered their lives. In English law, that would be enough for him to be charged with a crime here - and so the route was open for Mr Assange to face trial for the same in the United States. But British extradition law also requires a judge to consider Mr Assange's health. And it's the effect of his possible detention in near-solitary confinement in a \"supermax\" prison that proved decisive. The US, in the judge's conclusion, can't stop a mentally unwell man taking his own life in those conditions. And so the legal requirement to treat Mr Assange humanely trumps the seriousness of the case that the judge acknowledges he should answer. When the US appeals - it'll have to convince more senior judges otherwise. What would Assange face in the US? If convicted in the US, Mr Assange faces a possible penalty of up to 175 years in jail, his lawyers have said. However the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years. Mr Assange faces an 18-count indictment from the US government, accusing him of conspiring to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which was then published on the Wikileaks website. He says the information exposed abuses by the US military. But US prosecutors say the leaks of classified material endangered lives, and so the US sought his extradition from the UK. Extradition is the process under which one country can ask another to hand over a suspect to face trial. What reaction has there been? Following the judgement, several politicians and organisations welcomed the news, although some expressed dismay that the ruling was made on health grounds: Mr Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May 2019 for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He sought refuge in the embassy for seven years from 2012 until he was arrested in April 2019.

A British-born alleged militant was originally convicted of masterminding the operation, with three accomplices. However, Pakistan's top court has now upheld a ruling acquitting the men. A lawyer for Daniel Pearl's family said they were in \"complete shock\", and the decision was a \"travesty of justice\". Meanwhile, US officials have indicated they will try and launch legal proceedings against the man accused of his murder, Omar Saeed Sheikh, in the US. He denies wrongdoing. What happened to Daniel Pearl? In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US, Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl travelled to Pakistan, working on stories about militant groups. He would end up becoming their victim himself. First, haunting pictures of him in chains and with a gun to his head were released. Then, he was beheaded. His gruesome death was filmed by the extremists, a grim precursor to the tactics that have now become a common part of the propaganda videos of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. Omar Saeed Sheikh, the man accused of his murder, was born in Britain, where he attended a private, fee-paying school in East London, as well as the London School of Economics. However, he was drawn into jihadist circles. In 1994 he was imprisoned in India, after allegedly kidnapping a number of Western tourists. He was freed, along with two other militants, five years later, when gunmen hijacked an airliner, forcing it to land in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and demanded the men be released in exchange for the passengers. The prosecution alleged Sheikh first met Daniel Pearl at a hotel in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi in January 2002. Police said Mr Sheikh had used a fake name and pretended to be a follower of a hard-line cleric Pearl wanted to interview. Mr Sheikh's lawyers deny he was at that meeting place, or that any conspiracy to abduct Mr Pearl was hatched there. What is clear is that Pearl flew to the port city of Karachi expecting to conduct an interview, but instead he was kidnapped. His abductors demanded better treatment for detainees held by American forces at Guantanamo Bay, the return of all Pakistani men being held there, and bizarrely for a militant group, also called for the US to either deliver a consignment of fighter jets that had been promised to Pakistan but then halted, or return the money for them, plus interest. In the end, Pearl was murdered, accused, as an American Jewish man, of being a Mossad agent. Why were they acquitted? Following an investigation, Mr Sheikh and three other men were arrested, charged and then convicted in 2002. There seemed strong evidence that Mr Sheikh had masterminded the kidnapping, having been identified at the hotel in Rawalpindi by two separate eyewitnesses. But the prosecution case was deeply flawed. The Supreme Court decision on Thursday cleared him of any wrongdoing. It's widely acknowledged that Mr Sheikh first handed himself over to Pakistan's powerful intelligence services. However, police and prosecutors attempted to gloss over that, and instead, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, claimed he had been arrested a week later, wandering around Karachi airport. What's more, evidence began to emerge that Mr Sheikh had not physically carried out the murder himself. Instead, it's now thought a senior al-Qaeda operative currently in Guantanamo Bay, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (no relation), was responsible. The Pakistani authorities, however, deliberately discounted testimony suggesting that was the case. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, two former leading figures in the investigation told the BBC of their frustration at how it had been handled. One said the decision to try and brush over discrepancies in the timeline, and ignore evidence suggesting Mr Sheikh was not present at the time of the murder, undermined the rest of the case, even though they believed it was clear he had orchestrated the abduction. In April 2020, a high court in Sindh acquitted Mr Sheikh and the other three men of murder. The ruling was condemned by media rights groups, and the men remained in detention while Daniel Pearl's family and the Pakistani government appealed the decision. However, Pakistan's Supreme Court has now dismissed the appeals. What do Daniel Pearl's friends and family think? Journalist Asra Nomani, a close friend of Daniel Pearl's, who was with him in Karachi before the abduction, led an in-depth investigation into the incident, in conjunction with Georgetown University. Their work substantiated claims that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had carried out the beheading, but she believes that Omar Sheikh should remain in prison. \"Omar Sheikh is the man responsible for Danny's kidnapping, and he is the man who set up the circumstances so that Danny was ultimately murdered,\" she told the BBC. Daniel Pearl's elderly parents, Ruth and Judea, have expressed their dismay at the prospect of the men being released. In a video statement last year, Ruth Pearl spoke emotionally: \"There's not a single day that we don't miss our son.\" Omar Sheikh's lawyer however, said his client has been cleared by Pakistan's top court and deserves to be freed immediately. Prior to Daniel Pearl's death, many in the media believed they would be safe interviewing members of militant groups, granted a kind of immunity as neutral observers. His shocking murder changed that, and heralded the repeated, deliberate attacks on reporters by extremists that would follow. It is a tragic legacy for a talented journalist.", "summary1": "Pakistan's Supreme Court has ordered the release of four men accused of the murder of US journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002."}

At the event, the rapper seemed to make policy decisions off-the-cuff and made several rants, including on abortion and on abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Fans have questioned whether his last-minute bid for the White House is actually a promotional stunt. The Charleston rally did little to clarify whether his run is genuine. But a now-deleted tweet sent from West's account on Saturday, appearing to show the song list for a new album, added to the speculation. The event, held at a wedding and conference hall in the city, was said to be open to registered guests only - but West's campaign website had no function for people to register or RSVP. What did Kanye West say at the rally? West appeared with \"2020\" shaved into the back of his head and wearing a protective security vest, and addressed the gathered crowd without a microphone. There were no audience microphones either, leading West to repeatedly tell the crowd to be silent so he could hear the questions being asked. At one point he began crying when talking about abortion, saying that his parents almost aborted him: \"There would have been no Kanye West, because my dad was too busy.\" He added: \"I almost killed my daughter... even if my wife [Kim Kardashian West] were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn't want to.\" However he then added that he believes abortion should remain legal, but there should be financial support for struggling new mothers - suggesting that \"everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars\". \"The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land,\" he said. \"Abortion should be legal because guess what? The law is not by God anyway, so what is legality?\" At another moment, he gave an impromptu monologue about 19th century abolitionist Harriet Tubman. \"Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people,\" he said. Tubman was born into slavery, but managed to escape a Maryland plantation in 1849, aged 27. She then returned to the South to rescue other slaves on the network of routes and safe houses known as \"underground railroad\", risking her own life to lead people to freedom. West also became tearful when talking about his late mother, who died in 2007 from complications during cosmetic surgery. What has the reaction been? The speech has been met with anger by some - mostly sparked by his comments about Tubman - but also with concern over West's welfare. Professor Jason Nichols, a senior lecturer in African American studies at the University of Maryland, told the BBC he feared West's rambling appearance pointed towards a \"manic episode\" - although he acknowledged he was not a psychologist. \"He has admitted in the past he has been battling mental illness and that sometimes he does not take medication. \"He was a little more coherent than he has been in other times... when he has gone on these rants, but I really believe he is in a bad place right now. He said some really bizarre things.\" Professor Nichols added that he was disappointed, as he had hoped West would be able \"to push the other candidates\", had he had the right advice and support. \"I was actually interested to see what would happen, but after the event today, all that interest has just turned to worry.\" Will Kanye West actually be on state ballots? West, who announced his candidacy on 4 July, has already missed the deadline to qualify for the ballot in several states. He needs to collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot in a number of others.

He has repeatedly downplayed the virus and encouraged Brazilians to ignore medical advice on social distancing. It follows Twitter’s deletion of a homemade treatment tweeted by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Both social networks rarely interfere with messages from world leaders, even when they are verifiably untrue. Twitter, for example, says it will “will err on the side of leaving the content up” when world leaders break the rules, citing the public interest. But all major social networks are under pressure to combat misinformation surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter has updated its guidance on combating medical misinformation that goes against international public health guidance. And Facebook has similarly committed to removing information that could cause physical harm. President Bolsonaro’s posts showed him talking to people in the streets of Taguatinga. Facebook said it had removed the video from both that site and Instagram, which it also owns. The posts violated its community standards for causing harm, it told BBC News. Follow-up statements issued to Buzzfeed and The Verge clarified the claim about hydroxychloroquine was the main reason for its deletion. The World Health Organization says while some drug cocktails may have an impact, there is no proven drug treatment. And hydroxychloroquine and a related compound, chloroquine, are unproven, experimental treatments. But despite the lack of clinical trials, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has now approved both compounds, listed as anti-malarial drugs, for “emergency use” in Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital. The potential for possible treatment outweighed the known risk, the FDA said. But US President Donald Trump promoted the idea of hydroxychloroquine as an effective cure last week, before the FDA’s move. And his personal lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, had a tweet deleted for claiming it was “100% effective” in treating the virus. He had been quoting another President Trump supporter, Charlie Kirk, whose tweets were also deleted. In the UK, a “rapid response unit” within the Cabinet Office has been established to work with the social networks to remove fake news and harmful content.", "summary1": "Facebook and Twitter have deleted posts from world leaders for spreading misinformation about the coronavirus."}

Still, there appears to be a preference growing for the Pfizer and Moderna jabs over the Johnson & Johnson option. In early March, Detroit mayor Mike Duggan rejected the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for city residents, suggesting that the other two jabs available in the US were superior. \"I am going to do everything I can to make sure the residents of the City of Detroit get the best,\" he said in a press conference. After widespread outcry from the public health community, the mayor did an about-face, saying he had \"full confidence\" that the jab was safe and effective. But like Mr Duggan, some Americans have also shown concerns about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and its overall efficacy rates - even though health officials have cautioned those numbers don't tell the whole story. Some say they'd rather delay their vaccination than take Johnson & Johnson at all, potentially throwing a wrench into the distribution plans of community health officials. \"I had an appointment for a vaccine this week, and I cancelled it because I heard they were giving out Johnson & Johnson. I'm not taking [that vaccine] at all,\" one Washington DC resident told the BBC. Now, health officials like Dr Michele Andrasik are trying to reassure Americans that any authorised vaccine offered to them is a good one to take. \"On one hand, people are excited that there's just one shot [for Johnson & Johnson], and on the other, there's a lot of confusion with regard to what the efficacy results actually say and does this mean it's not as good,\" Dr Andrasik, senior staff scientist for the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at Fred Hutch, told the BBC. In February, US regulators formally approved the single-shot Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine - the latest to get the green light. Unlike Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which use new mRNA vaccine technology and require two shots, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a common cold virus that has been engineered to make it harmless. It then safely carries part of the coronavirus's genetic code into the body. This is enough for the body to recognise the threat and then learn to fight coronavirus. President Joe Biden has shown confidence in the vaccine. This month, he announced that the US will order 100 million more doses of Johnson & Johnson, doubling the amount available to Americans. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that all the vaccines available in the US were good vaccines, and stressed that the Johnson & Johnson jab is \"not the weaker vaccine\". The concern comes down varying to efficacy data released from clinical trials - but those figures aren't all they appear to be, say experts. Health officials have stressed that the most important statistic in fighting the pandemic is that all three vaccines have 100% prevention of hospital admissions and death from the virus. The Pfizer and Moderna drugs were also tested before newer, more contagious variants were widespread, making a difference in trials. \"They were not compared head-to-head. They were compared under different circumstances,\" Dr Fauci has said. Additionally, the CDC explains that all the vaccines are more effective than the annual flu shot. \"The bottom line is that Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer are all incredibly effective at preventing severe disease progression, hospitalisation, winding up in the ICU or on ventilation, or death,\" says Dr Andrasik. Another positive of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, community health advocates say, is that it is the only single-shot vaccine available in the US. It may also be more convenient when it comes to distribution - especially in harder-to-reach places like some poor or rural regions. But there is concern that sending just that vaccine to those areas might increase stigma. \"Equity involves choice,\" says Dr Andrasik. \"So, if you only have one choice and you are a disenfranchised population, I think that fuels the idea of inequity, uncertainty and questioning of why we only have this one choice.\" She adds: \"I think that all the vaccines should be available for everyone. I think the rationale of sending Johnson & Johnson to rural [and poorer] communities is because of access to care.\" Community leaders and health professionals like Dr Andrasik are making efforts to spread awareness about the vaccine and combat misinformation. When over half a million people have died from Covid in the US, \"as soon as it's my turn, I will take whatever vaccine is available to me at that time\", she says. What are other concerns? The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was also recently in the news after the US Conference of Catholic Bishops - which represents the church in the US - and others expressed \"moral concerns\" with the jab. The concern is over how it is produced with abortion-derived cell lines - cells taken in the 1980s \"originally isolated from fetal tissue, some of which were originally derived from an aborted fetus\" - like a number of other vaccines available today. Johnson & Johnson used a similar method in developing its Ebola vaccine - and no Covid-19 vaccine contains human tissue of any kind. The conference advised that, given a choice, Catholics should take an alternate vaccine. The advice given by the US conference seemed to contradict the Vatican's own stance, which is that such vaccines are \"morally acceptable\". Other Catholic leaders have come out to reject the idea that church members should avoid this vaccine. In Connecticut, the Archbishop of Hartford and other local clergy declared in a statement that all residents \"should feel free in good conscience to receive any of the vaccines currently available ...for the sake of their own health and the common good\". While many other vaccines, such as those used for chicken pox and rubella, were developed similarly, the latest concerns from Catholic leaders for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has added to scepticism among some Americans. Johnson & Johnson isn't the only vaccine facing concerns.

Last August, 22 people were killed in a shooting targeting Mexicans at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. Hate crimes have been increasing in the US almost every year since 2014. Campaign groups warn this comes amid rising bigotry and racist rhetoric. \"The latest rise in hate crime signals a new brutal landscape, where targeted attacks against rotating victim groups not only result in spikes, but increases are also being driven by a more widely dispersed rise in the most violent offenses,\" said Brian Levin, executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. The FBI's annual Hate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA) report says there were 7,314 hate crimes last year, up from 7,120 the year before - and the highest number since 7,783 were recorded in 2008. A hate crime is defined in the report as offences \"motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity\". The data showed a nearly 7% rise in religion-based hate crime, with a 14% increase in crimes targeting Jews or Jewish institutions. It also found anti-Latino hate crime rose 8.7% from 485 in 2018 to 527 in 2019 to the highest total since 2010. The killing of 22 people at the El Paso Walmart last year is the worst hate crime attack ever recorded by the FBI, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. Black people were targeted in hate crimes more than any other group in the US. However, the FBI said the number of hate crimes against African Americans dropped slightly to 1,930, from 1,943. Of all 4,930 victims of reported hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity, 48.5% were \"victims of crimes motivated by offenders' anti-Black or African American bias\", compared with 15.7% as \"victims of anti-White bias\", 14.1% as \"victims of anti-Hispanic or Latino bias\" and 4.4% of \"anti-Asian bias\". After the FBI report's release rights groups called for better reporting of and collection of information on hate crimes. A press release from the Jewish civil rights group the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said the data revealed \"a harrowing trend of increasing hate crimes being reported in the United States, even as fewer law enforcement agencies provided data to the FBI\". \"The total severity of the impact and damage caused by hate crimes cannot be fully measured without complete participation in the FBI's data collection process,\" ADL director Jonathan Greenblatt said.", "summary1": "Hate crimes in the US rose to the highest level in more than a decade last year, according to an FBI report."}

The study looked into 291 pregnancies that ended in stillbirth and 735 women who had a live birth. Researchers say the position which women fall asleep in is most important - and they should not worry if they are on their back when they wake up. About one in 225 pregnancies in the UK ends in stillbirth and the study authors estimate that about 130 babies' lives a year could be saved if women went to sleep on their side. The MiNESS study, published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (BJOG) is the biggest of its kind, and confirms findings from smaller studies in New Zealand and Australia. Is waking up on your back a problem? Prof Alexander Heazell, clinical director at the Tommy's Stillbirth Research Centre at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester, who led the research, advises women in their third trimester to sleep on their side for any episode of sleep, including daytime naps. \"What I don't want is for women to wake up flat on their back and think 'oh my goodness I've done something awful to my baby'. \"The question that we asked was very specifically what position people went to sleep in and that's important as you spend longer in that position than you do in any other. \"And also you can't do anything about the position that you wake up in but you can do something about the position you go to sleep.\" Tips for going to sleep on your side Source: Tommy's charity Researchers can't say for certain why the risk of stillbirth is increased - but there is a lot of data that suggests when a woman is lying on her back, the combined weight of the baby and womb puts pressure on blood vessels which can then restrict blood flow and oxygen to the baby. Edward Morris, from the BJOG, said the new research was \"extremely welcome\" . \"This is an important study which adds to the growing body of evidence that sleep position in late pregnancy is a modifiable risk factor for stillbirth.\" The pregnancy charity Tommy's has started a campaign to raise awareness of the study and to encourage women to sleep on their side. Michelle Cottle's baby Orla was stillborn at 37 weeks in 2016 after a healthy pregnancy where there were no signs that anything was wrong. She writes a blog \"Dear Orla\" and hears from women who have been through the same experience. Michelle, whose daughter Esme was born a year later, says practical advice like this for mothers is important to make them feel more in control. \"I really think it helps to empower people, as it feels like something you can go away and do with the hope of having a more healthy pregnancy and a better outcome than sadly lots of people do have. \"I look back now and I actually feel quite traumatised by my (second) pregnancy because it was a bit like living your worst nightmare every single day. \"Every time there's maybe a quiet moment and you don't know whether your baby is alive or not is absolutely terrifying. \"Night-time is the worst as well because a lot of people would say they believe that their baby died maybe when they were sleeping. I think that's really scary because you have to sleep. \"So I think having clear things that can help you feel a bit more in control is really important for women.\"", "summary1": "Women are being advised to sleep on their side in the last three months of pregnancy to help prevent stillbirth."}

In comparison, France had vaccinated 138 people in total by 30 December. More than 1.8m people have now died of the virus around the world. The comparative figures on vaccination are put together by Our World in Data, which is a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity. They measure the number of people who have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Most of the vaccines approved for use so far rely on two doses, given more than a week apart. The US fell far short of its target of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, with just 2.78 million having received a jab by 30 December. Meanwhile, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said he does not agree with UK plans to give as many people as possible a first vaccine dose, while delaying second doses. Dr Fauci said the US would not be adopting a similar strategy. India has meanwhile approved two vaccines for emergency use - the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the Covaxin vaccine, developed locally by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Two further vaccines are awaiting approval. The country aims to vaccinate 300 million people by the middle of the year and has been staging drills to prepare for mass distribution. How has Israel got so far ahead? Israel began vaccinations on 19 December and is delivering jabs to about 150,000 people a day, with priority given to the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. It secured supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following negotiations early on in the pandemic. It is contacting people with priority access to the vaccine through its health care system - by law all Israelis must register with a recognised health care provider. Israel has safely subdivided shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, which must be stored at -70C, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told YNet TV news. This means smaller batches of the vaccine can be sent out to remote communities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is campaigning for re-election, has predicted Israel could emerge from the pandemic as early as February. It is currently in its third national lockdown. Why is France lagging behind? In the first three days of its vaccination campaign, which launched on 27 December, France inoculated fewer than 100 people. In comparison, Germany had given more than 190,000 vaccines by Saturday. The EU was slower than the UK or US to authorise any of the vaccines. The European Medicines Agency, the regulator for the 27 EU member states, gave its approval for the Pfizer vaccine on 21 December, compared to 2 December in the UK and 11 December in the US. Part of the difficulty in France stems from the widespread scepticism about the vaccination. In a 15-country poll carried out by Ipsos Global Advisor, just 40% of French respondents said they would be willing to have the vaccine. This compares to 80% in China, 77% in the UK, and 69% in the US. Earlier this week, the French health minister defended the slow pace of vaccinations, saying authorities had chosen to give the jab in care homes to elderly residents, rather than making them travel. However, on Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron struck a more urgent tone, saying: \"I will not allow an unjustified slowness to set in without good reason.\" What is India doing? India is holding a national drill for its vaccination programme, which is aiming to reach 300 million people by the middle of the year. Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said 10 million healthcare workers and 20 million other frontline staff will be prioritised for the jabs. Authorities will initially rely on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been recommended by a government panel. The Oxford jab does not require the same storage at extremely low temperatures as the Pfizer vaccine, making it suitable for distribution to areas without sophisticated health care facilities. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where it is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Another vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech, has been approved for emergency use. Covid-19 has already claimed nearly 150,000 lives in India, with about 10 million people infected - second only to the number infected in the US.", "summary1": "Israel has given vaccinations against coronavirus to more than one million people, the highest rate in the world, as global immunisation efforts step up."}

In Milan tear gas was used to disperse protesters, and thousands of people gathered in the centre of Naples. The demonstrations began soon after the national government's order to close restaurants, bars, gyms and cinemas came into effect at 18:00 local time. Many regions have also imposed night-time curfews - including Lombardy, where Milan is, and Piedmont, where Turin is. The violence was blamed on extremist agitators and police said 28 people had been arrested in Milan alone. Protests took place in about a dozen other cities, including Rome, Genoa, Palermo and Trieste. Taxi drivers occupied a central square in Turin while restaurant owners beat pots and pans in the centre of Cremona. In Naples, a big crowd gathered in the central Piazza del Plebiscito, many calling on the regional governor to resign. While an initial national lockdown earlier this year was complied with little resistance, the announcement of renewed measures has been met with immediate pushback. Small businesses argue that they are still recovering from that first lockdown, and that more restrictions could bankrupt them. Mood in Italy begins to turn The days of clapping for medical staff and of rainbow banners reading \"everything will be alright\" seem a distant memory. The virus may be back - but the near-total support for the anti-Covid fight that Italians showed in the first wave is breaking. The protests so far are not huge. The vast majority of Italians still seem to understand the need to tighten measures, fearful that cases are again spiralling out of control. But the world's first national lockdown - and one of its longest - has taken its toll, with an economy forecast to shrink by 10% this year. Some on the streets are peaceful: an agonised call for help by restaurateurs or gym-owners. But a mix of far-right and far-left agitators, organised crime groups and bored football hooligans have sensed an opening, looting shops and clashing with police. The interior minister warns of \"an autumn of social tension\". This is a risky moment for the government. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has pledged quick financial help. The president has stressed that \"the enemy is the virus.\" But the mood of a nation scared into compliance in March is beginning to turn. A number of luxury stores in central Turin, including a Gucci boutique, were ransacked by crowds that spilled into the streets after the rules came into force. Demonstrators let off firecrackers and lit flares, while police in riot gear responded with tear gas. In Milan, crowds chanted \"Freedom, freedom, freedom!\" as they clashed with police in the city centre. The city is the capital of Lombardy, which has been particularly hard hit by the virus. What measures has Italy introduced? Restaurants, bars and cafes must stop table service at 18:00 and offer only take-away until midnight. Contact sports are prohibited but shops and most businesses will remain open. The new restrictions, which are in force until 24 November, will also see 75% of classes at Italy's high schools and universities conducted online instead of in a classroom. Regional governments had asked for all classes to be conducted via distance learning, Italian media reported, but the move was opposed by Education Minister Lucia Azzolina. The government is also urging people not to travel outside their home towns or cities unless absolutely necessary and to avoid using public transport if possible. \"We think that we will suffer a bit this month but by gritting our teeth with these restrictions, we'll be able to breathe again in December,\" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told a news conference on Sunday. What's happening elsewhere in Europe? Gyms and pools have also closed in the Belgian capital Brussels, and shops must shut at 20:00. Masks are now compulsory in public spaces. These rules will remain in force until 19 November. Meanwhile doctors in the Belgian city of Liège have been asked to keep working, even if they have coronavirus. The head of the Belgian Association of Medical Unions told the BBC they had no choice if they were to prevent the hospital system collapsing within days. In the UK, people aged 16 to 25 are more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job during the pandemic, BBC Panorama has found. Research seen by the programme also suggests the education gap between privileged and disadvantaged young people has widened further. In France, health experts have warned that the number of new Covid-19 cases per day could be about 100,000 - twice the official figure. Prof Jean-François Delfraissy, the head of France's scientific council which advises the government on the pandemic, said the estimated figure included undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases. He told RTL radio he was surprised by the \"brutality\" of the second wave which he expected to be much worse than the first, adding: \"Many of our fellow citizens have not yet realised what awaits us.\" France has already imposed night-time curfews on major cities, including Paris. The country has recorded more than 1.1 million cases in total and 34,780 deaths. The Czech Republic has also introduced a night-time curfew, which came into effect on Tuesday at midnight for a week. Nobody will be allowed to leave their homes between 21:00 and 04:59 each night except to travel to and from work, for medical reasons or a few other exceptions. All shops will be shut on Sundays and will close at 20:00 on other days. Spain has declared a national state of emergency and imposed a night-time curfew amid a new spike in Covid-19 infections. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the curfew, which came into force on Sunday night, would be in place between the hours of 23:00 and 06:00. Under the measures, local authorities can also ban travel between regions. Spain has seen more than one million cases and 34,750 deaths. Russia has registered a record 17,347 new daily coronavirus cases, officials said on Monday. Total reported cases have surpassed 1.5 million - but the mayor of the worst-hit city, Moscow, said that while \"there is still growth... it is slower\".", "summary1": "Protests took place across Italy on Monday over new restrictions to curb the country's second wave of Covid."}

Brands appear willing to pay handsomely to sponsor posts, videos, stories and blogs, too, says Business Insider. But one expert insists it will not mean the end of traditional advertising. \"Digital marketing is the equivalent of word of mouth but there will always be a mix between that and traditional advertising,\" said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, chief executive of social media marketing platform Socialbakers. The report looked at sponsored content on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and blogs, examining negotiated rates from 2014 to 2019. From micro-influencers - people with fewer than 100,000 followers - to celebrities, it found that there was good money to be made. Among the findings were: Consumer law warning As more and more people join the rush to become social-media influencers, the industry has gained more scrutiny from regulators. Last month, three influencers had Instagram posts touting diet products banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, which dubbed them \"irresponsible\". And at the beginning of the year, the Competition and Markets Authority warned that some influencer posts could break consumer law if they did not make clear when posts endorsing products were ads. Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntingon-Whiteley were among 16 influencers who agreed to change the way they posted content. Brands will continue to pour money into social-media advertising, according to data from Socialbakers. Its research suggests that influencer-sponsored posts grew by 150% in the last year, with the use of the hashtag #ad more than doubling. It predicts that brands will up their spend on influencer marketing in 2020, making it a $10bn industry. Instagram is currently experimenting with hiding \"likes\" on posts but Mr Ben-Itzhak does not think this will have an impact on the influencer industry. \"Influencers will still be able to see what engagement they have and it is common practice to grant permission to brands so that they can see that too,\" he said. \"The bigger question will be whether consumers will continue to engage when they can't see 'likes'.\"", "summary1": "The money made by social-media influencers has risen meteorically in the last few years, according to a new report."}

He told a court in Tokyo on Wednesday that the allegations against him \"are all correct\". But his lawyers argue that his charges should be reduced because his victims apparently gave consent to be killed. If convicted of murder, Mr Shiraishi faces the death penalty, which is carried out by hanging in Japan. The court case has attracted wide interest, with more than 600 people lining up for 13 public gallery seats to watch the first hearing on Wednesday, reported public broadcaster NHK. What happened? The prosecution say the accused opened a Twitter account in March 2017 \"to contact women contemplating suicide, whom he saw as easy targets\", NHK said. Eight of his victims were female, one of them aged 15. The only male victim, aged 20, was killed after confronting Mr Shiraishi about the whereabouts of his girlfriend, Japanese media reported. The 29-year-old is believed to have lured his victims by telling them he could help them die and in some cases claimed he would kill himself alongside them. His Twitter profile contained the words: \"I want to help people who are really in pain. Please DM [direct message] me anytime.\" The serial killings first came to light when police were looking into the disappearance of a young woman, who later turned out to be one of the victims. Officers visited Mr Shiraishi's flat in the Japanese city of Zama, near Tokyo, where they found dismembered body parts. What do his lawyers say? Mr Shiraishi's lawyers argue his victims had agreed to be killed, so the charges should be reduced to \"murder with consent\". This carries a lower prison sentence of between six months and seven years. But it is reported that Mr Shiraishi disagrees with his lawyers. He told Mainichi Shimbun, a local daily, that he killed without the consent of his victims. \"There were bruises on the back of the victims' heads. It means there was no consent and I did it so that they wouldn't resist,\" he said in comments published on Wednesday. What impact have the killings had? The serial killings have stunned Japan. When they were exposed in 2017 it triggered a new debate about websites on which suicide is discussed. At the time the government indicated it may introduce new regulations. The murders also prompted a change by Twitter, which amended its rules to state users should not \"promote or encourage suicide or self-harm\". Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey said at the time the case was \"extremely\" sad. Japan has long battled one of the highest suicide rates in the industrialised world although figures have dropped since preventative measures were introduced more than a decade ago.

Homes have been washed away and a number of roads blocked or destroyed. Large parts of east Africa have suffered floods and landslides in recent weeks. Hundreds have died and millions have been displaced. The events have been linked to an unusual weather phenomenon in the Indian Ocean, Meanwhile, in Somalia, the authorities are trying to assess the damage caused by tropical storm Pawan, which brought wind and torrential rain to part of the northern coast on Saturday, cutting communications with the town of Eyl. What happened in Uganda? Heavy rain has been battering the country for weeks, and intensified overnight on Friday into Saturday. Police, military, aid agencies and community members are assisting with search and rescue operations in more than a dozen affected areas. Rain is hampering communications in the locations in the remote west of the country, AFP news agency reported. The Red Cross said its volunteers continued to recover more bodies, including some trapped in cocoa trees in the Bundibugyo hills, describing the events as \"devastating\". Last week landslides caused by heavy rain claimed a number of lives in the east of the country. Uganda's disaster management agency has advised people not to walk, ride or drive across any flooded roads or bridges, and to keep away from river banks and steep slopes. How about Somalia? Somalia's north-eastern Puntland state had been bracing for Cyclone Pawan, which was downgraded to a storm before it made landfall in an area already suffering the impact of recent high winds and flooding. At least one person is reported to have died after a fishing boat capsized, while in the Eyl area, a child was reported to have died from exposure after houses and livestock were washed away. BBC Africa correspondent Ann Soy says it appears most people had fled or been evacuated from Eyl, a small coastal city, but buildings were destroyed and communications infrastructure was damaged. Some roads in Puntland have been destroyed making transport difficult. Flights into and out of Gorowe were suspended all of Saturday, but they have now resumed. There are numerous reports of loss of livestock to floods in villages, something that threatens the livelihoods of local communities, our correspondent adds. What's been the wider impact of heavy rains? Heavy downpours have devastated parts of East Africa over the last two months, with the Horn of Africa seeing up to 300% above average rainfall between October and mid-November, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network. Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia and South Sudan have been particularly badly affected, with flash floods and landslides hitting communities across the region. Almost 300 people have reportedly died and 2.8 million people have been affected, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.", "summary1": "Flooding in Uganda has claimed at least 16 lives, the Red Cross says, as the region reels from weeks of rain."}

So, the detective was sent to our family home in the middle of the night with a signed warrant to arrest her for the crime of what can only be called illegal expression. I was working on the other side of the world and people were sending me videos of her being released from the police station at 01:30, wearing my father's shirt. A few hours later, she was back online and writing about this abuse on her website, in-between mocking the new prime minister's insecurities and poking fun at her own appearance. \"I apologise for being in total disarray but when the homicide squad turns up at your home to arrest you at night… brushing your hair, bringing out the powder and blusher and sorting out some fetching clothes are the last thing on your mind,\" she wrote. Now, the same detective who arrested my mother that night finds himself in charge of the investigation into her murder. On the day she was killed my mother, Daphne Caruana Galizia, drove to the bank to regain control of her account, which had been frozen at the request of a government minister. She had just turned 53 and was at the peak of her 30-year career as a journalist. Half a kilo (1lb) of TNT packed into a device under her car seat was remotely detonated. Supporters of the government openly celebrated the assassination, reminding me of those who celebrated the shooting of Turkish-Armenian newspaper editor Hrant Dink. Others insinuated that I had planned the murder myself, or that my mother had happily risked her life - the same slander that was repeated about James Foley, the US correspondent who was abducted and beheaded in Syria. The murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia Why do these murders matter so much? \"The free flow of facts and opinions, the stock and trade of journalists, creates societies that are fairer and freer,\" my brother told a gathering of European diplomats, while we were still reeling from our loss. \"It creates societies that are richer and more resilient: in other words, societies that are worth living in.\" After our mother's murder, our only light was the outpouring of support, remorse, sadness and regret coming from all kinds of people. It surprised me and brought to mind something that a friend once told me: \"Good people are everywhere; you have to find them.\" The desire to live in a society that's free and open, where the law is the same for everyone and human rights are respected, is universal. But as with most desires it blows hot and cold. It's often too late when we realise that a few bad people, who, like human disease, will always be with us, have taken over. The task that my brothers, my father and I have set out for ourselves since our mother's murder is enormous: justice for her murder, justice for her investigations and making sure that nothing like this happens again. There is now little time for anything else. Within my family, we sometimes talk to each other about how little patience we have for the inaction and indifference of others, especially those in positions of authority. We find it difficult not to attack their cynicism and their laziness. The children of Turkish investigative journalist Ugur Mumcu told me that after their father was murdered with a car bomb, the chief of police excused their failure to investigate by saying: \"We cannot do anything, there's a brick wall in front of us.\" Their mother's reply to this was: \"So remove one brick, then another, until you take the whole wall down.\" That is what we have been doing ever since our mother was murdered. My guiding principle at the beginning was to do our best come what may. I now think that the process is almost as important as our goals. We're forcing cultural change and generating more respect for free expression by the simple act of making the state do its duty and deliver justice. We've joined others who are eradicating the disease of \"unfreedom\" and teaching the world a new respect for human rights in the process. \"Freedom starts with freedom of conscience,\" the writer Yameen Rasheed told us five days before he was stabbed to death outside his home in the Maldives in 2017. \"Without that fundamental freedom of the mind, what would you do with the other freedoms?\" Like my mother's, his murder showed that there was no respect for those freedoms in our countries. It's not just up to us, the ones left behind, to take up that fight for freedom: the family members, girlfriends, boyfriends and friends of murdered and imprisoned journalists. This great responsibility has landed on our shoulders but we cannot carry it alone. We need good people everywhere to join us. World Press Freedom Day I know there are more of us. Remember that Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi was loved by people everywhere. It was only one person who hated him enough to have the writer killed. In all of these murders, including my mother's, there is little or no sign that the state is making a meaningful effort to convict the people who are ultimately responsible. So, we've started by removing the first brick: demanding Malta launches a public inquiry to find out for itself where it went wrong in preventing the murder of its most important journalist. Then, we'll move on to the next brick. Every day, I wish my mother never had to make this sacrifice on behalf of her country and I would much rather she were still alive. But like Khadija Ismailova, an Azeri journalist whose imprisonment was described as \"outrageous\" by human rights groups, said: \"If we really love, we want our loved ones to be who they are. And this is who Daphne was - fighter and hero.\" What my mother will never know is that her death inspired thousands of acts of heroism, in Malta and beyond. And I like to think that each one of these acts has, in one way or another, protected other brave journalists from my mother's fate.

The two countries have run an internationally recognised joint vaccine development programme for more than three decades. They have worked on stopping dengue, enteric diseases, influenza and TB in their tracks. Trials of a dengue vaccine are planned in the near future. India is among the largest manufacturer of generic drugs and vaccines in the world. It is home to half a dozen major vaccine makers and a host of smaller ones, making doses against polio, meningitis, pneumonia, rotavirus, BCG, measles, mumps and rubella, among other diseases. Now half a dozen Indian firms are developing vaccines against the virus that causes Covid-19. One of them is Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker by number of doses produced and sold globally. The 53-year-old company makes 1.5 billion doses every year, mainly from its two facilities in the western city of Pune. (It has two other small plants in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.) Around 7,000 people work for the firm. The company supplies some 20 vaccines to 165 countries. Some 80% of its vaccines are exported and, at an average of 50 cents a dose, they are some of the cheapest in the world. Now the firm has stitched up collaboration with Codagenix, an American biotech company, to develop a \"live attenuated\" vaccine, among the more than 80 reportedly in development all over the world. This vaccine is created by reducing the virulence - or removing the harmful properties - of a pathogen but keeping it alive. (They cause no or very mild disease because the pathogen is weakened under laboratory conditions.) \"We are planning a set of animal trials [on mice and primates] of this vaccine in April. By September, we should be able to begin human trials,\" Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India, told me over the phone. Mr Poonawalla's firm has also partnered to mass produce a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and backed by the UK government. A genetically engineered chimpanzee virus would form the basis for the new vaccine. Human clinical trials began in Oxford on Thursday. If all goes well, scientists hope to make at least a million doses by September. \"It's pretty clear the world is going to need hundreds of millions of doses, ideally by the end of this year, to end this pandemic, to lead us out of lockdown,\" Prof Adrian Hill, who runs the Jenner Institute at Oxford, told the BBC's Health and Science correspondent James Gallagher. This is where Indian vaccine makers have a head start over others. Mr Poonawalla's firm alone has an extra capacity of 400 to 500 million doses. \"We have lots of capacity as we have invested in it,\" he says. There's more. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech had announced a partnership with the University of Wisconsin Madison and US-based firm FluGen to make almost 300 million doses of a vaccine for global distribution. Zydus Cadilla is working on two vaccines, while Biological E, Indian Immunologicals, and Mynvax are developing a vaccine each. Another four or five home-grown vaccines are in early stages of development. \"The credit must go to entrepreneurs and pharmaceutical companies who invested in quality manufacturing and in processes that made it possible to produce in bulk. The owners of these companies have also had the goal of doing good for the world, while also running a successful business and this model is a win-win for all,\" Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist of the World Health Organization (WHO), told me. Experts warn that people should not be expecting a vaccine in the market any time soon. David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, says humans will have to live with the threat of coronavirus \"for the foreseeable future\" because there's no guarantee that a vaccine will be successfully developed. And Tim Lahey, a vaccine researcher at the University of Vermont Medical Centre, warns that there's a \"good reason to worry a coronavirus vaccine would elicit harmful immune responses too\". Global Covid-19 infections have hit nearly 3m with more than 206,000 deaths. Developing a safe vaccine which can be mass produced is going to be a time consuming exercise - every lot has to be chemically and biologically tested before being released. \"But we are hopeful, very hopeful, of having a safe and efficacious vaccine in two years or less,\" says Mr Poonawalla.

At the most common kind of Amazon \"fulfilment centre\", serious injuries are 50% higher for those that have robots than those without, it says. Amazon said its numbers were high because it encouraged the reporting of even minor incidents. The report from journalist Will Evans was published on the centre's own news website. It accuses the giant online retailer of \"bald misrepresentations the company has deployed to hide its growing safety crisis\". It said Amazon officials had \"profoundly misled the public and lawmakers\" over its safety record. The company, however, said: \"We strongly refute the claims that we've misled anyone. \"The reporter is misinterpreting data, and the very internal documents he claims to have obtained ultimately illustrate one thing - we have a deep focus on the safety of our teams.\" Injuries rise with the robots Amazon first introduced robots into its warehouses after acquiring a robotics manufacturer in 2012. But workers speaking to Reveal said the robots ferrying items through the warehouse meant they were now confined to workstations, standing still and repeating monotonous tasks. On top of that, the robots were much more efficient - meaning that productivity expectations for human workers had increased too. Pickers at the warehouse, for example, said they had seen their expected number of items to handle grow from 100 to 400 an hour. Internal documents show that facilities with the robots have injury rates about 50% higher than those without, the report says. Last year alone, there were 14,000 \"serious\" injuries - requiring days off or job restrictions - and the overall injury rate was almost double the industry standard, it says. A few warehouses reported as many as five times as many injuries as the industry average, measured in serious injuries per 100 workers. Amazon said that the injury rate in the reports used by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration was not a metric for \"serious injury\". The \"Dart\" rate - \"days away, restricted or transferred\"- was higher for Amazon because it \"encourages someone with any type of injury, for example a small strain or sprain, to stay away from work until they're better\", the company said. It did not, however, directly respond to the claim that the number of these incidents was higher in robotics-equipped facilities than those without. 'Misleading' claims The report also says Amazon's public statements are misleading, based on its discoveries - something Amazon fiercely denies. The company says improving safety is a key part of the robot's purpose, alongside improving efficiency. Jeff Wilke, Amazon's chief executive of consumer business, argued in 2019 that robotics had a beneficial impact on safety. \"Making jobs safer by implementing robotics is just a win for everybody - making jobs more interesting, allowing people to take advantage of their innate human creativity instead of doing rote things over and over again,\" he said. Reveal's analysis of the data it received found that 2019's \"Prime Day\" sales period was \"the year's most dangerous week for injuries at Amazon fulfilment centres, with nearly 400 serious injuries recorded across the country\". But Amazon said that was based on a misunderstanding because there were more workers employed at peak periods, and in fact the number of injuries per worker remained stable or even declined during those periods. 'Millions spent on safety' Amazon has long faced a public relations battle over how its treats its employees. In the UK, the GMB union alleged that hundreds of Amazon workers had sufferd serious injury or narrowly avoided an accident. Data shows that the number of injuries reported in the UK have increased in recent years - but so too have the number of warehouses. Workers have staged strikes over the \"Prime Day\" workload or, more recently, coronavirus safety measures. The company says it has has spent some $55m on safety improvements in its warehouses over the past two years. Responding to the allegations in the Reveal report, Amazon said it was constantly learning, and improving its safety procedures. \"We continue to see improvements in injury prevention and reduction through programmes focused on improved ergonomics, delivering guided physical and wellness exercises, providing mechanical workstation assistance equipment, improving workstation setup and design, forklift telematics, and forklift guardrails to separate equipment from pedestrians - to name a few,\" it said.", "summary1": "Amazon's use of robots in its warehouses has led to more injuries for human workers, an investigation says."}

Author of 11 novels, she won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, having published her first novel, The Bluest Eye, in 1970. Her 1987 book Beloved told the story of a runaway female slave and was made into a film starring Oprah Winfrey in 1998. Morrison once said: \"We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.\" The Morrison family statement said the \"extremely devoted mother, grandmother, and aunt\" had \"passed away peacefully last night [5 August] surrounded by family and friends\". \"The consummate writer who treasured the written word, whether her own, her students or others, she read voraciously and was most at home when writing,\" it continued. \"Although her passing represents a tremendous loss, we are grateful she had a long, well lived life.\" Morrison died at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York. The family added: \"While we would like to thank everyone who knew and loved her, personally or through her work, for their support at this difficult time, we ask for privacy as we mourn this loss to our family. \"We will share information in the near future about how we will celebrate Toni's incredible life.\" Her long-time editor, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf publishers, said: \"She was a great woman and a great writer, and I don't know which I will miss more.\" And Sonny Mehta, the chairman of Knopf, said: \" I can think of few writers in American letters who wrote with more humanity or with more love for language than Toni. \"Her narratives and mesmerising prose have made an indelible mark on our culture. Her novels command and demand our attention. \"They are canonical works, and more importantly, they are books that remain beloved by readers.\" Her fiction When she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Swedish Academy described her as an author \"who in novels characterised by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality\". In 1996 she was honoured with the National Book Foundation's Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, In 2012, President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Morrison was also the first female African-American editor at Random House, where she had the role from 1967 to 1983. She championed writers of colour and published the likes of Gayl Jones, Henry Dumas, Muhammad Ali and Angela Davis, among others. Morrison also taught at Princeton University. 'Storyteller through and through' Professor Noliwe Rooks, who worked with Morrison at Princeton, told the BBC her debut novel, whose protagonist was a young black girl, had broken new ground when it was released in 1970. \"At this moment when [The Bluest Eye] comes out - who's writing about black girls? Who's writing about this kind of trauma? Who's writing about the interior lives of someone like that? Who's writing about black communities?\" said Prof Rooks. \"There was no one who was doing it the way she was, with the truth-telling and the ugliness, as well as the grandeur and the beauty.\" Prof Rooks, now at Cornell University, added that Morrison \"could make a story about going car-shopping sound like some kind of Homeric odyssey\". \"From the moment she left her house to the riding in the back of the Bentley was somehow an epic adventure,\" she said. \"Both at the level of the mundane as well as the epic, the well-honoured, she was a story-teller through and through.\" 'May she rest in power' President Obama remembered Morrison on Tuesday as \"a national treasure\" who was \"as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page\". \"Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination,\" he said. \"What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while.\" Many, including the former tennis champion and activist Billie Jean King, signed off a tribute tweet with: \"May she rest in power.\" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote that her death was \"such a loss\", declaring: \"The world needs voices like Toni Morrison's today more than ever.\" In her own tribute, TV writer and producer Shonda Rimes said she had grown up \"wanting to be only her\".

He added that his government was investigating the fires. Earlier, Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles was heckled at a meeting on climate change. Conservationists have blamed Brazil's government for the Amazon's plight. They say Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged the clearing of land by loggers and farmers, thereby speeding up the deforestation of the rainforest. Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space research (Inpe) shows an increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil, most of them in the Amazon region. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. What exactly did Bolsonaro say? Answering questions from reporters on Thursday, Mr Bolsonaro said the government couldn't simply get the ministry of the interior to send 40 men to fight a fire. \"Forty men to fight a fire? There aren't the resources. This chaos has arrived,\" he said. On Wednesday, the president had suggested that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) could have started fires as revenge for his government slashing their funding. Asked on Thursday who was responsible for starting the fires, he responded: \"The Indians, do you want me to blame the Indians? Do you want me to blame the Martians?... Everyone is a suspect, but the biggest suspects are NGOs.\" Asked if there was any proof of this, he replied: \"Did I accuse NGOs directly? I just said I suspect them.\" President Bolsonaro has further angered those concerned over the spike in fires by brushing off the latest data. He argued that it was the season of the \"queimada\", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting but Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. It is not the first time Mr Bolsonaro has cast doubt on figures suggesting that the Amazon is deteriorating rapidly. Last month, he accused Inpe's director of lying about the scale of deforestation and trying to undermine the government. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88% increase in deforestation in the Amazon in June compared to the same month a year ago. The director of the agency later announced that he was being sacked amid the row. What happened to Ricardo Salles? As the minister took to the stage at the Latin American and Caribbean Climate Week in the Brazilian city of Salvador, some of those present shouted \"the Amazon region is burning\". As soon as his name was announced, most of those attending the opening session of the plenary booed and shouted, with only a few people clapping. The conference, organised by the United Nations, aims to promote action on climate change in the region. It is being attended by representatives from non-governmental organisations, businesses and educational organisations, among others. What are people upset about? Climate activists and conservationists have been scathing about the Bolsonaro government and its policies, which favour development over conservation. They say that since President Bolsonaro took office, the Amazon rainforest has suffered losses at an accelerated rate. Their anger was further fuelled by satellite data showing a steep rise in fires in the Amazon region this year. The figures suggest there have been more than 75,000 fires so far this year for the whole of Brazil, compared with just over 40,000 over the same period in 2018. It is the highest number of fires in Brazil since 2010. The figures and satellite images showing most of the state of Roraima, in northern Brazil, covered by smoke have shocked many Brazilians and triggered a global Twitter trend under the hashtag #prayforamazonia. The US space agency, Nasa, has on the other hand said that overall fire activity in the Amazon basin is slightly below average this year. The region is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. Amazon fires cause stir on social media BBC UGC and Social News team The plight of the Amazon has seen millions take to social media to decry reports of a massive yearly increase in forest fires. But some of the most striking - and viral - pictures shared by social media users are not all they seem. The hashtag #PrayForAmazonia started to be widely used on Tuesday. It has been included in almost three million tweets since. The most widely shared tweet using that hashtag - with more than a million likes and retweets - includes two aerial images of forest fires, neither of which show the current situation. One dates as far back as 1989. And other widely shared images include fires as far away as Siberia or the United States. A video of a Pataxo woman angrily accusing illegal ranchers of starting fires has almost five million views. But the video has been shared on social media since at least July. So while it may point to one potential reason for the reported increase in forest fires, it's not necessarily a depiction of the present situation. What causes the fires? Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. \"The dry season creates the favourable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,\" Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer told Reuters news agency. Ricardo Mello, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Amazon Programme, said the fires were \"a consequence of the increase in deforestation seen in recent figures\". This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010.", "summary1": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has said his government lacks the resources to fight the thousands of fires in the Amazon."}

The charges are not related to the Mueller probe that is examining alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. She allegedly worked at the direction of a high-level Kremlin official. Ms Butina's attorney Robert Driscoll said in a statement released on Monday that his client was \"not an agent\" and instead just an international relations student \"who is seeking to use her degree to pursue a career in business\". He added the charges were \"overblown\" and there was \"no indication of Butina seeking to influence or undermine any specific policy or law or the United States\". Mr Driscoll said his client had \"been co-operating with various government entities for months\" over the allegations. Ms Butina, who lives in Washington, was arrested on Sunday and was held in jail pending a hearing set for Wednesday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement. The announcement of her arrest came hours after US President Donald Trump met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and defended the Kremlin against claims of interference in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump said there had been no reason for Russia to meddle in the vote. The arrest also came days after the justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections. What is she accused of? In a sworn statement unsealed on Monday, FBI Special Agent Kevin Helson said her assignment was to \"exploit personal connections with US persons having influence in American politics in an effort to advance the interests of the Russian Federation\". She did so without registering her activities with the US government, as required under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, prosecutors say. Ms Butina sought to foster ties with an \"organisation promoting gun rights\", the DOJ said, without naming any group or politicians. According to an affidavit, she was trying to \"establish a 'back channel' communication for representatives of the Government of Russia\". The criminal complaint states that she focused on developing personal connections with influential US politicians to \"advance the interest\" of Russia. As a part of that alleged mission, the complaint says Ms Butina was organising an event to further influence \"the views of US officials as those views relate to the Russian Federation\". Ms Butina reported back to an official in the Russian government about her progress using Twitter direct messages among other means, according to the complaint. In one message, the Russian official told Ms Butina: \"Your political star has risen in the sky. Now it is important to rise to the zenith and not burn out (fall) prematurely.\" The affidavit also states that the unnamed official was sanctioned by the US Treasury. Who is she? Ms Butina, originally from Siberia, came to the US on a student visa to study at American University. The complaint alleges that she was in fact secretly working for the Russian government. She founded a group called the Right to Bear Arms before she arrived in America, and US media have previously reported her ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA), the most powerful gun lobby in the US. She has previously denied having worked for the Russian government. The Washington Post reported that she became an assistant to Russian banker and former senator Alexander Torshin. He was sanctioned by the US Treasury in April. Mr Torshin, who is a lifetime member of the NRA, and Ms Butina attended NRA events in the US beginning in 2014. She also attended a Trump campaign event and reportedly asked Mr Trump about his views on foreign relations with Russia. \"We get along with Putin,\" Mr Trump had answered, according to the Washington Post.", "summary1": "The US government has charged a 29-year-old Russian woman with conspiracy to act as a Russian government agent while infiltrating political groups."}

The issue gained greater urgency in recent weeks as fighting between the Ethiopian government and local forces in the Tigray region threatened to spread south to Gondar city, where most of the Jews are now housed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival, Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz, greeted the 316 new arrivals at Ben Gurion Airport. \"My wife Sarah and I stood there with tears in our eyes at the welcoming,\" Mr Netanyahu said in a statement, \"when we see the immigrants, our Ethiopian Jewish brothers, leave the plane... come down and touch the ground, the land of Israel. \"You waited so long to realise the dream and today it is being realised.\" Immigration Minister Pnina Tamano-Shata - herself an Ethiopian-born immigrant brought to Israel in a clandestine airlift in 1984 - went to Ethiopia to oversee Thursday's transfer, dubbed Operation Rock of Israel. The community, known as Falash Mura, are descendants of Jews who converted to Christianity - many under duress - in the late 19th Century. In recent decades they have identified as Jewish again, living their lives in accordance with the faith. However, unlike the Ethiopian Jewish community - known as the Beta Israel - previously evacuated to Israel, Falash Mura do not fulfil the criteria for automatic right to Israeli citizenship due to uncertainties over their ancestral lineage according to Jewish law. The issue dragged on for years, until the government pledged in 2015 to transfer the whole community by the end of 2020. Although 16,600 Falash Mura have applied to emigrate to Israel, its interior ministry said this week, until now only 2,000 of those who qualified had been brought. The pace of the process has led campaigners to accuse the government of reneging on its promise. About 100 more are expected to arrive on Friday, and the government says another approximately 1,700 will follow by the end of January 2021. Ethiopian Jews were first brought to Israel from refugee camps in Sudan in a series of secret operations in the early 1980s by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency on the orders of the then Prime Minister Menachem Begin.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53733841", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Sally NabilBBC Arabic, Cairo Mawada, a 22-year-old university student, was last month sentenced to two years in prison after being convicted of violating Egyptian family values. She was arrested in May after publishing videos on TikTok and Instagram where she lip-synced to famous songs and danced in fashionable clothes. The prosecutor found her videos indecent. Mawada has more than three million followers on TikTok, and 1.6 million on Instagram. \"She only wanted to be famous and popular,\" laments Rahma. 'The TikTok girls' Mawada is one of five young women who were given the same prison sentence, in addition to a fine of nearly $20,000 (£15,300; 17,000 euros). The five are known as the \"TikTok girls\". Aside from Mawada, the group includes another social media star, Haneen Hossam, and three others who have not been named. Rahma says her sister was modelling on social media for a number of well-known fashion brands. \"She was just too ambitious. She dreamt of being an actress. \"Why her? Some actresses dress in a very explicit way. Nobody touches them,\" she asks angrily. According to human rights group Amnesty International, prosecutors used 17 photos of Mawada against her as evidence of \"indecency\". Mawada said these images had been leaked from her phone after it was stolen last year. Mawada and the other four women began an appeal against their convictions on Monday, and the next hearing is scheduled for 14 September. At the very least, Rahma hopes her sister's sentence will be reduced. Mawada fainted when she heard the initial verdict, according to her lawyer, Ahmed Bahkiry. \"She's totally devastated - the charges are very vaguely worded.\" \"Prison cannot be a solution, even if some of her videos go against our social norms and traditions,\" he adds. \"Prisons create criminals. The authorities could have resorted to rehabilitation instead.\" There are mixed feelings in Egypt towards the case. Some in this largely Muslim, conservative country view TikTok videos such as Mawada's as indecent. Others say the girls were only having fun and do not deserve prison. Human rights groups see the girls' arrests as a further attempt by the authorities to restrict freedom of expression and as a sign of what Amnesty called \"new repressive tactics to control cyberspace\". There are, campaigners say, tens of thousands of political prisoners in Egypt, including liberals, Islamists, journalists and human rights lawyers. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi insists there are no prisoners of conscience in his country, while the state has questioned the credibility of critical human rights reports. 'Reckless and licentious' Among those calling for the girls' release is the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, a Cairo-based human rights organisation. Its executive director, Mohamed Lotfy, says the case shows clear signs of gender discrimination. \"Women are only allowed to express themselves on social media according to the state's dictations,\" he says. \"The girls are accused of breaching Egyptian family values, but no-one has ever defined these values.\" Even if they were to be released, Mr Lotfy says a warning has already been sent to young girls. \"The authorities have made it clear: you are not free to say or do whatever you like, even if you are not talking politics at all. There are lines which are not to be crossed.\" In recent months, the public prosecutor's office issued statements highlighting what it called the \"potential dangers threatening our youth via digital platforms, which are not subject to any sort of supervision\". It called on parents to help stop young people being \"misled into adopting a reckless and licentious lifestyle, in search of worthless fame and success\". \"They pursued illegal paths to make money, falsely believing this is a form of freedom of speech,\" it said. Meanwhile, as a result of what has happened, Rahma says their mother \"barely leaves her bed now\". \"She cries all the time,\" she says. \"Sometimes she wakes up at night and asks if Mawada is back home.\" You may also be interested in:", "summary0": "\"We were left in utter shock.

People identified as being at risk are advised to stay at home and inform local health authorities. The technology shines a light on the Chinese government's close surveillance of its population. To make an inquiry users scan a Quick Response (QR) code on their smartphones using apps like the payment service Alipay or social media platform WeChat. Once the new app is registered with a phone number, users are asked to enter their name and ID number. Every registered phone number can then be used to check the status of up to three ID numbers. The app was jointly developed by government departments and the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation and supported by data from health and transport authorities, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. It is widely known that the Chinese government conducts high levels of surveillance on its citizens but experts in the field suggest, in this case at least, it will not be seen as controversial within the country. Hong Kong-based technology lawyer at the law firm DLA Piper Carolyn Bigg told the BBC: \"In China, and across Asia, data is not seen as something to be locked down, it's something that can be used. Provided it's done in a transparent way, with consent where needed.\" \"From a Chinese perspective this is a really useful service for people... It's a really powerful tool that really shows the power of data being used for good,\" she added.

'Close contact' covers: For example, all air passengers within three rows of an infected person, as well as cabin staff, are seen as being in close contact, while other passengers would be recorded as having general contact.

The company said it was blocking more than 100 million phishing emails a day. Over the past week, almost a fifth were scam emails related to coronavirus. The virus may now be the biggest phishing topic ever, tech firms say. Google's Gmail is used by 1.5 billion people. Individuals are being sent a huge variety of emails which impersonate authorities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), in an effort to persuade victims to download software or donate to bogus causes. Cyber-criminals are also attempting to capitalise on government support packages by imitating public institutions. Google claims that its machine-learning tools are able to block more than 99.9% of emails from reaching its users. The growth in coronavirus-themed phishing is being recorded by several cyber-security companies. Barracuda Networks said it had seen a 667% increase in malicious phishing emails during the pandemic. Scammers have been sending fake emails and text messages claiming to be from the UK government, the WHO, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and even individual US officials, including President Trump. \"Phishing attacks always share the common trait of inciting or depending on an emotion that causes us to act more hastily or think less about our actions at that moment in time,\" said independent security researcher Scott Helme. \"The coronavirus pandemic is a highly emotional topic right now and cyber-criminals clearly know this. They're hoping that the typical person might be more inclined to click through links or follow bad instructions if they use this lure.\" 'Exploitation' Researchers have also found malicious websites and smartphone applications based on genuine coronavirus resources. One malicious Android app claims to help track the spread of the virus, but instead infects the phone with ransomware and demands payment to restore the device. Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre and the US Department of Homeland Security issued a joint advisory. They said they had seen \"an increasing number of malicious cyber-actors\" that were \"exploiting the current Covid-19 pandemic for their own objectives\".

He said it was in response to \"threats in the region\", amid efforts to protect the kingdom from \"Iranian aggression\". The move comes after an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities in September. \"Taken together with other deployments, this constitutes an additional 3,000 forces that have been extended or authorised within the last month,\" Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said. The US has increased the deployment of forces in the region by 14,000 since May, according to CNN. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had requested additional support, Mr Esper said. The attack on Saudi oil facilities knocked out 5% of global oil supply and sent oil prices soaring. Both Saudi Arabia and the US blame Iran for the incident. Mohammed bin Salman said: \"If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests.\" Iran has denied allegations it was behind the attack. However the leaders of France, Germany and the UK said in a joint statement that there was no other plausible explanation for the attacks. Mr Esper told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday that the evidence from other recent attacks in the region proved Iran was to blame. He said the \"malign behaviour\" was a part of the country's \"larger campaign to destabilise the Middle East and disrupt the global economy\". \"Iran's attempts to use terror, intimidation and military force to advance its interests are inconsistent with international norms,\" Mr Esper added. \"Saudi Arabia is a longstanding security partner in the Middle East and has asked for addition support to supplement their own defences and defend the international rules-based order.\" Always on the verge of coming home Analysis by Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent You would be forgiven for feeling confused about President Trump's attitude to US military deployments in the Middle East. At one point in the past few days he was tweeting about the \"trillions of dollars\" that America had wasted on \"endless wars\" in the region and vowing that the US would \"back out\" of Middle East conflicts. Yet here we are with a further 3,000 service personnel and a bunch of hardware heading for Saudi Arabia and the region - making a net 17,000 increase in troop numbers since May. So unquestionably the rhetoric and the reality are in conflict. President Trump is not the first incumbent of the White House to face these contradictory pressures. President Barack Obama had to reverse his pledge in 2015 to bring all American troops, bar a handful, home from Afghanistan. There are 14,000 of them there to this day. And the 2011 withdrawal of troops from Iraq had to be revisited when the vacuum left created space for al-Qaeda and then the Islamic State group. The truth is that as a world superpower, America's national interest cannot be contained within the bounds of the two shining seas that many of the early political pioneers thought would protect it from foreign entanglements. Yet the president, in similar fashion to some of his predecessors, has to persist in the assertion that troops are always on the verge of coming home. He and they do it for sound political reasons: that's what the American people, in general, want to hear. President Donald Trump has often defended the US relationship with Saudi Arabia and its leader, calling the kingdom a vital ally with a record amount of investments in the US. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have cast a critical eye over the kingdom since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi involvement in the civil war in Yemen. In June, the Republican-controlled Senate voted to block the sale of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia in a rebuke of Mr Trump. US lawmakers have expressed concerns that Saudi-led forces would use the weapons against civilians in Yemen. As the US prepares to send more support to the kingdom, Mr Trump has also faced pushback from Congress on his decision to pull troops from Syria. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham both criticised the withdrawal as irresponsible, saying it risks allowing terrorist organisations to regroup. On Monday, Mr Trump defended the move, saying: \"We want to bring our soldiers back home. These are endless wars.\" The president has been vocal about the matter on Twitter this week, calling US involvement in the Middle East the \"worst decision ever made in the history of our country\".", "summary0": "The Pentagon has announced the deployment of thousands of additional troops to \"enhance the defence of Saudi Arabia\".", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-50021913", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Sakataren Tsaro na Amurkar, Mark Esper ya ce ya amince da aikewa da karin dakaru da suka hada da jiragen yaki da kuma na'u'rorin kariya.

It is the first time the UN has asked for such a wide-ranging appraisal. After taking office in March, Pope Francis said cracking down on sex abuse was vital for the Church's credibility. He said the Vatican needed \"to act decisively as far as cases of sexual abuse are concerned, promoting, above all, measures to protect minors, help for those who have suffered such violence in the past (and) the necessary procedures against those who are guilty\". His predecessor, Benedict XVI, had promised to rid his Church of the \"filth\" of clerical sex abuse. Observers said he went further than ever before in tackling the legacy of abuse, though critics said that was not far enough, accusing him of failing to protect children from paedophile priests. 'Room for optimism' The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is a legally-binding instrument which, once signed by member states, commits them to protecting and nurturing the most vulnerable in society. The Geneva-based UNCRC, which governs the convention, sent a \"list of issues\" to the Vatican in view of obtaining \"detailed information on all cases of child sexual abuse committed by members of the clergy, brothers and nuns or brought to the attention of the Holy See\". The information relates to all cases between November 1995 and January 2014, the UN said. The questionnaire seeks to establish whether \"perpetrators of sexual crimes\" were allowed to remain in contact with children and what legal action was taken against them. The appraisal also asks whether reporting of suspected abuse was mandatory. In addition it includes queries about support for victims, and any incidents where complainants were silenced. The British National Secular Society said there was \"room for optimism that [Pope Francis] will try much harder than his predecessor to address this issue which has caused so much pain, made so much worse by the Church's actions and inactions over decades, if not centuries\". But observers say that although the Convention on the Rights of the Child is legally-binding, the Vatican may be able to refuse this request from the committee.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53811539", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Shrai PopatBBC News, Washington Although the amendment was ratified on 18 August 1920, it was preceded by decades of organising and protests - spearheaded by leading figures of US women's suffrage like Susan B Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The 19th amendment is considered to be a seminal piece of legislation, but for minority women - particularly African-American, Hispanic and Native-American women - there was a long road ahead to ensure complete access to the vote. To mark this year's centennial, the BBC spoke to a number of women running for office - both Republican and Democrat - to see what has been achieved and what is left to do. 'Little by little, those glass ceilings are coming down' Jennifer Carroll Foy, Gubernatorial Candidate for Virginia (Democrat) \"It's poetic that we have such a consequential presidential election in the 100th year that women have been able to vote,\" Jennifer Carroll Foy said. A native of Petersburg, Virginia, she was raised by her grandmother - whose trademark adage was, \"if you have it, you have to give it.\" It is a truth that Ms Carroll Foy seeks to employ in her politics. While she is excited about celebrating the centennial of the 19th amendment, she is acutely aware that the amendment wasn't wholly inclusive. Black and brown women faced an arduous journey to achieve equal voting access - that wasn't conferred until the Voting Rights Act in 1965. \"As a black woman there is still work to be done,\" she said. \"Until all women have full and unfettered rights to vote, the fight for women's right to vote continues.\" For Ms Caroll Foy, on the centennial of the 19th amendment, it's even more important to have a woman of colour on the ballot. \"When you don't see women in power, it's hard to fathom that being a possibility,\" she said. \"It's not lost on me that I would be the first black woman governor in our country.\" Similarly, on this anniversary, Senator Kamala Harris' spot on the Democratic ticket is particularly auspicious for Ms Carrol Foy, as it paves the way for black and brown girls everywhere to \"see themselves in her\". 'I don't know how many men get called 'honey' at a council meeting' Beth Van Duyne, Candidate for the US House of Representatives in Texas, District 24 (Republican) \"I think about how far we have come,\" Beth Van Duyne said. \"It's incredibly humbling to be one of the record number of Republican women running for Congress this year.\" According to Ms Van Duyne, the 19th amendment's ratification has heralded decades of advancements for women. From the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, to the number of women enrolled in higher education, by way of new businesses founded by women. \"It's very gratifying to see that women are empowered, are supported, and are achieving success in greater numbers,\" she said. But Ms Van Duyne's 16-year career in politics has been chequered by misogyny at various points. As the first female mayor of Irving, Texas, she remembers having to overcome an \"old boy network\" of all-male city council members. \"I approached it from the outside in,\" she recalled. \"I don't know how many men get called 'honey' at a council meeting.\" Moving forward, Ms Van Duyne is encouraged by the swathes of women entering politics. \"As you get a more reflective body, you'll see less division,\" she added. 'I still think we have a long way to go to make everyone able to vote' Julie Oliver, Candidate for US House of Representatives in Texas, District 25 (Democrat) As a child, raised in a low-income household by a single parent, Julie Oliver wasn't sure how her mother put food on the table. \"I had no idea how she did it, but she did it,\" Ms Oliver said. Her mother's tenacity inspired Ms Oliver's own run for Congress. This is her second run for District 25 in Texas, which encompasses Austin and Central Texas. \"I always say, 'can you imagine what Congress would look like coming from the heart of a mother?'\" she told BBC News. When she initially ran for Congress in 2018, she joked that her husband should have talked her out of the idea. Instead, she recalls how he encouraged her to run. \"I'm grateful for the enlightened men in my life,\" she added. As a woman in politics, Ms Oliver believes that greater representation in the House would lead to a more collaborative policy approach across party lines. \"Women have similar goals when it comes to education, access to healthcare and investing in infrastructure.\" Although the anniversary of the 19th amendment is cause for celebration for giving \"a certain group of women the right to vote,\" Ms Oliver feels that the centennial is an opportunity to reflect on the work remaining to enfranchise minority women across the country. \"It includes all women, not just white women,\" she said. Ensuring that black and brown voices are empowered is integral to Ms Oliver's run for office. \"But I hope people call me out when I'm not doing enough,\" she said. \"I want to be held accountable.\" 'As a working mother, how do I look after my people?' Valerie Ramirez Mukherjee, Candidate for US House of Representatives in Illinois, District 10 (Republican) Throughout her career in business and finance, Valerie Ramirez Mukherjee said that she was lucky to not experience gender discrimination, but would often hear from women who did. \"I want to help solve this,\" she said. \"How do we get others to experience what I've experienced?\" Ms Ramirez Mukherjee and her brother were the first in their family to attend university, and she recalls that their mother didn't raise them to see any difference between genders. \"I didn't see that there was a 'role' of a girl or a boy,\" she said. \"It was about who had the skill or the interest to get the job done.\" It was when Ms Ramirez Mukherjee wanted to start a family, that she was made to feel aware of her gender. Her two pregnancies were difficult, and she realised that trying to find time for necessary doctor's appointments during the work day would unsettle her male colleagues. Now, in her first run for public office, Ms Ramirez Mukherjee is focused on creating transparency for women in the workplace. \"100 years later and we're still having this conversation,\" she said. \"If a woman decides to start a family, how do we talk about that more?\" When it comes to the state of voting access in the US, Ms Ramirez Mukherjee is \"grateful\" that the mail-in ballot has become a widely discussed option this year. She believes that this will empower more people, particularly women, to vote. \"Not everyone has the privilege to go down to the polling station,\" she said.", "summary0": "This year marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment in the United States, which guaranteed American women the right to vote.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-53824454", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Jennifer Carroll Foy na fatan zama baƙar mace gwamna ta farko a Amurka Duk da cewa an amince da gyaran fuskar da aka yi ranar 18 ga watan Agustan 1920, an shafe tsawon shekaru ana tsarawa da kuma yin zanga-zanga - wanda fitattun mata a Amurka irinsu Susan B Anthony da Elizabeth Cady Stanton suka jagoranta.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53295551", "lang0": "english", "text0": "On 4 May, Fathima Rinoza, a 44-year-old mother of three from Sri Lanka's minority Muslim population, was admitted to hospital with a suspected case of Covid-19. Fathima, who lived in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, had been suffering from respiratory problems and the authorities feared she had caught the virus. On the day she was admitted to hospital, the family was \"set upon\" by the authorities, her husband Mohamed Shafeek said. \"The police and military along with officials arrived at our door,\" he said. \"We were kicked out and they sprayed [disinfectant] everywhere. We were all scared but they didn't tell us anything. Even a three-month-old baby was tested and they took us like dogs to the quarantine centre.\" The family was held for a night but released the next day and told to quarantine for two weeks, Mohamed said. By then, they had received news that Fathima had died, at the hospital, on her own. Fathima's adult son was asked to go to the hospital to identify his mother's body. He was told that her body could not be returned to the family, he said, as her death was linked to Covid-19. Instead he was forced to sign papers authorising her cremation, the family said - even though under Muslim law cremation is considered a violation of the human body. \"He was told that her body parts needed to be removed for further tests. Why would they need body parts if she had corona?\" said his father Shafeek, who feels the family were not fully informed about what happened. Fathima's family and others in Sri Lanka's Muslim community say the authorities are violating their rights by forcing them to cremate victims even though coronavirus victims can be buried. They argue it's the latest step in a pattern of discrimination by the majority Sinhalese population. A petition against the cremation rule has been accepted by the country's Supreme Court, which will begin hearing the case on 13 July. Many Muslims in Sri Lanka feel they have been demonised since April 2019, when Islamists linked to little-known local groups targeted high-end hotels and churches in Colombo and in the east of the country, killing more than 250 people in a spate of devastating attacks. Since the death of the first Sri Lankan Muslim from coronavirus on 31 March, some media outlets have openly blamed the Muslim community for spreading the disease, even though only 11 deaths have been officially recorded in the country. All 11 bodies, including Muslims, were cremated. Dr Sugath Samaraweera, the government's chief epidemiologist, told the BBC it was government policy that all those who die from Covid-19, as well as those suspected of dying from it, are cremated, as burials could contaminate ground drinking water. Dr Samaraweera said the government was following expert medical advice, and applying the rule to anyone suspected of dying from coronavirus, regardless of religion. \"The WHO offers guidelines for the whole world. It is our responsibility to adopt or customise those guidelines suitable to our country,\" he said. But Muslim activists, community leaders and politicians have asked the Sri Lankan government to reconsider the decision. Ali Zahir Moulana, a former minister and senior leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress party, said the Muslim community was prepared to accept the rule \"if there is evidence or scientific backing to prove that burial is dangerous to public health\". But he questioned the science behind it, and accused the government of pursuing a \"dark political agenda\". Interim guidance published by the WHO in March says victims of coronavirus \"can be buried or cremated\", and does not mention dangers to groundwater. On the same day that Fathima died, 64-year-old Abdul Hameed Mohamed Rafaideen passed away at his sister's house in Colombo. The labourer and father of four had been suffering from breathing difficulties. His youngest son, Naushad Rafaideen, told the BBC that a neighbour from the majority Sinhala community died the same day. Because of lockdown travelling restrictions, local police asked the family to take the body of the neighbour, together with their father's body, to the hospital. At the mortuary, the doctor told Naushad he was not allowed to touch his father's body because of the risks of Covid-19, even though it wasn't clear whether the virus was the cause of death. Naushad, who cannot read, was asked to sign some papers which gave permission for his father's body to be cremated. He said he wasn't sure what would happen to him if he didn't sign, but he feared a backlash against his family and community if he refused. He said the Sinhalese family was treated differently, and allowed to pay respects to their relative at a funeral parlour, though the BBC could not independently verify this. Only Naushad and a handful of relatives were allowed to attend the cremation of his father, he said. Meanwhile, nearly six weeks after the death of his wife, Shafeek is unsure whether she ever tested positive for coronavirus, and he is struggling to come to terms with not being able to bury her body. One thing he was sure of, he said. \"We Muslims do not cremate our dead.\"", "summary0": "Sri Lankan authorities are insisting on cremation for coronavirus victims - a practice forbidden by Islam.

And now, South Korean boy band BTS have announced they will be performing a concert in Riyadh in October. So why does Saudi Arabia want high profile stars to perform there? The economy The Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has said he wants to reform the country both in social and economic terms as part of his Vision 2030 plan to show a modern Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has been relying on oil to make money for a long time, but instability in oil prices mean it's not as reliable now. So because of the need for economic reform and investment from outside the country, Saudi Arabia has been trying to show the world it's open for business. And attracting artists such as BTS is seen as a way to do that. Social reform One area Saudi Arabia is trying to grow is its entertainment industry. Lots of Saudi citizens travel outside the country to see concerts and films. To make sure they spend money inside Saudi, new cinemas and shopping centres are being opened and mainstream artists are being invited to perform. \"They're trying to create an inter-cultural communication between Saudi Arabia and the world,\" Yasmin, a 24-year-old Saudi resident, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"We have people from all around the world living in Saudi Arabia so by doing that they're trying to match everyone's taste.\" Some of these social reforms also include lifting the ban on women being able to drive and allowing them to attend football matches. Who's already performed there? In December 2017, Nelly performed a concert in Jeddah, but it was controversially a men-only event. At a Formula E concert, acts such as Jason Derulo, Enrique Iglesias, David Guetta, OneRepublic and The Black Eyed Peas all performed across three days. In January, Mariah Carey put on a performance, sharing the stage with Sean Paul and DJ Tiesto. Despite facing a major backlash, she claimed this was a chance to work towards gender equality in Saudi Arabia. Her publicists said: \"As the first female international artist to perform in Saudi Arabia, Mariah recognises the cultural significance of this event and will continue to support global efforts towards equality for all.\" And it's not just musical artists. The WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) held its Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia, despite its women wrestlers not being allowed to perform. So is the reality different? According to Yasmin, things are \"not as strict as they used to be\". She says in places like coffee shops and restaurants, \"everyone sits in the same section and you don't have that segregation anymore.\" But organisations such as Human Rights Watch (HRW) say there is doubt over how much change is actually taking place. Though they've been permitted to drive, HRW say women still face several barriers. They claim Saudi authorities have arrested several well-known women's rights advocates just before lifting the driving ban, accusing them of \"suspicious contact with foreign parties\". And women still have to obtain permission from a male guardian - a husband, father, brother or son - to do ordinary things such as travelling abroad, getting a passport, accessing healthcare and even being able to work. There is also criticism over its record on LGBT rights. Saudi Arabia has no actual written laws about sexual orientation or gender identity. But judges use principles of Islamic law to sanction people suspected of sex outside marriage, homosexual sex or other \"immoral\" acts, according to HRW. What are people saying? There's been mixed reactions to the news of the BTS concert, which was announced on Sunday. Some fans have said politics shouldn't be a factor in performing while others have said Saudi Arabia should be boycotted because of its human rights record. So it remains to be seen whether BTS will follow Nicki Minaj in cancelling or if we'll see them performing as planned in Riyadh in October.

Saudi Arabia arrested several women's rights activists earlier this year and influential clerics and intellectuals have also been detained. The BBC has approached the Saudi authorities for comment. However, a Saudi official told the Wall Street Journal the kingdom \"does not condone, promote, or allow the use of torture\". Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch issued statements on Tuesday detailing alleged torture of detained prisoners. Activists were left unable to walk or stand properly after electrocution and flogging, an Amnesty International release said, with one woman reportedly sexually harassed by interrogators in face masks. Human Rights Watch's release also speaks of electrocution, as well as whipping and \"forcible hugging and kissing\" of at least three detained women. King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were praised last year for launching a modernisation drive, including the lifting of a ban on women driving. But critics say that has been accompanied with a crackdown on dissent, and the country is also facing an international outcry over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing on rogue agents but denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. However, the CIA reportedly believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder.

It depicts the striker with his arms out wide in the goalscoring celebration he is known for. But people have suggested it looks more like singer Leo Sayer or Marv the burglar from the film Home Alone. The sculpture of Salah joins a long list of other sculptures in the football world that have left fans scratching their heads about likeness. It has drawn comparisons to a bust of Cristiano Ronaldo which was widely mocked after it was unveiled at Madeira airport last year. Emanuel Jorge da Silva Santos, who sculpted the bust, spoke of his sadness about the online criticism of his effort afterwards. He was later given a second chance at it by website The Bleacher Report. The youth forum, where the statue of Salah was unveiled, was attended by thousands, including Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. The event, which is in its second year, was created by young people in Egypt to help promote peace and prosperity. Sculptor Mai Abdallah told Egyptian media that she created the statue because Salah stood as a symbol of excellence for Egyptian youth, describing the artwork as \"distinguished and executable\". In a Facebook post, she addressed the criticism and said the brass statue came out looking differently to the original mould. \"I hope people learn the art of criticism politely and respect,\" she added. Salah scored 32 goals in just 36 appearances in his debut year at Liverpool last season, breaking records and garnering widespread praise. The 26-year-old signed a new five-year deal at the club earlier this year, and has had previous spells at clubs including Chelsea and Roma. Born in Nagrig in northern Egypt, Salah enjoys widespread popularity in his home country.

At least 26 people are believed to have died in the current outbreak. Health workers were among the first to receive the vaccine on Monday. What is Ebola? It is an infectious illness that causes internal bleeding and often proves fatal. It can spread rapidly through contact with small amounts of bodily fluid, and its early flu-like symptoms are not always obvious. More than 11,300 people died in the earlier outbreak in 2014-16. How serious is the current outbreak? At least 45 cases of Ebola have been reported, including three health workers, since the outbreak began earlier this month. The virus has already spread from rural areas to the north-western city of Mbandaka, a major transport hub on the River Congo, where at least four cases have been confirmed. This has sparked fears that the outbreak could reach the capital, Kinshasa, as well as neighbouring countries. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has \"strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control\". At an emergency meeting, on Friday WHO experts said that \"the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not currently been met\". What do we know about the medicine being used? The vaccine, made by pharmaceutical firm Merck, is not yet licensed, but was effective in limited trials during the West Africa outbreak. Dr Michel Yao, from the WHO, told the BBC that the vaccine had been tested in Guinea and that \"almost all of the people who were vaccinated could not get the disease\". The WHO has sent more than 4,000 doses to the Democratic Republic of Congo, with another batch set to follow. Health care providers and funeral workers are being vaccinated initially, before the programme is extended to more than 500 people who may have come into contact with those infected with the virus, in a so-called \"ring vaccination\". What are the challenges? One of the most immediate obstacles to the immunisation campaign is the country's unreliable electricity supplies, as the vaccine needs to be stored at a temperature of between -60 and -80 C. Initial stocks of the vaccine have arrived in Mbandaka city, but they must now be transported through densely forested areas to reach remote rural areas where many cases have been reported. A further issue is that, as the vaccine has not yet been approved, its use is dependent upon informed and signed consent from all patients. This means that translators will need to be brought in to aid communication between health workers and local communities. Life in the Ebola zone One teacher in the region told the BBC's Newsday programme that people had stopped shaking hands when they greet. Ziko Ilema said: \"I tried to greet a friend by shaking hands and he said: 'No, did you forget that Ebola is here?' \"They forbid people to greet by using hands, eating animals from the forest, and people are now living with fear.\" Ebola is thought to be spread over long distances by fruit bats and is often transmitted to humans eating contaminated bushmeat - meat from wild animals such as monkeys or antelopes. Bars, restaurants and offices in Mbandaka have started to provide soap and basins of water for people to wash their hands as a way to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the AFP news agency. It also reports that officials are using infrared thermometers at the city's river ports to scan travellers in case they have a fever. \"But we don't have enough of the thermometers, so people are crowding up and getting annoyed,\" said Joseph Dangbele, an official at the private Menge port. Health Minister Oly Ilunga has announced that all healthcare in the affected areas would be free. This is the ninth outbreak of Ebola in DR Congo - it was named after the country's Ebola river.", "summary0": "Health workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo have begun an immunisation campaign in an attempt to halt the spread of an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/45095670", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Mutune sama da 43 aka ruwaito sun kamu da cutar yayin da alkalumman farko na ma'aikatar lafiya a kasar suka ce mutane 30 sun mutu.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52927678", "lang0": "english", "text0": "Just a few years ago, local comedians had a field day with jokes about elderly Nigerian mothers and their nonchalant attitudes towards their mobile phones. They needed their children's assistance to type and send text messages or log in to their accounts and read emails. And their frequent excuse for missed calls was: \"My phone was in my handbag.\" These days, the jokes have upgraded to Nigerian mothers and their infatuation with WhatsApp, the most popular messaging app in Africa. Nigerian comedians like Maraji have been making skits about them. \"My mother spends her entire morning on WhatsApp,\" 39-year-old Udo, whose home is in Lagos, told me. \"Throughout while she's having her breakfast and drinking her tea, she's checking people's status updates and watching videos.\" 'Relevant messages' Unlike Twitter and Instagram, WhatsApp can work even when internet connections are iffy, as is often the case in many parts of Nigeria. And it requires no profiles or passwords, so the generation that mostly retired from active life before access to the internet became common in Nigeria finds it easy to use. In fact, it is their internet. A common complaint among younger Nigerians is the number and nature of WhatsApp messages they receive from their mothers. \"You just wake up in the morning and you see 10 videos from your mother,\" 41-year-old Ihuoma, who lives in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, told me. \"And each one begins with: 'You must watch this!' 'This will help somebody!' Those are always the opening lines.\" Her 76-year-old mother, Patty, told me that all the messages she forwards are \"relevant\". \"I don't send frivolous messages at all,\" she said. \"Why I send those things to my children, it is a form of education, lifting up of minds, sharing knowledge, experiences. I consider it a sort of fellowship, sharing with my children.\" Ihuoma has since muted her mother's WhatsApp account and rarely opens her messages. For many Nigerian mothers, the ability to broadcast ready-made messages via WhatsApp is like a superpower. It enables them to transmit unsolicited prayers, advice and opinions. One woman who complained on Twitter about her mother putting onions in the corner of every room in the house - touted on WhatsApp as a way to absorb toxins - received replies saying their mothers had also followed the erroneous advice. \"In our family group, my mother was always forwarding me and my siblings different health suggestions, concoctions to mix and drink,\" said Udo. \"When I pointed out to her that some of them are questionable, she replied: 'You never know, just try it and see.'\" Her mother also forwarded gory videos of kidnap victims and crime scenes, insisting that her children needed to see these to be aware and beware. \"That's when I left the family group and felt I could not do this any more,\" Udo said. \"My brother blocked her, which hurt her a lot. But she wouldn't listen. She keeps forwarding.\" Thongs, cancer and other fanciful warnings A number of people told me that they also had blocked their mothers on WhatsApp but did not want to let them know. \"I was once involved in an online debate about this,\" Ihuoma said. \"Some people were of the opinion that they wanted to block their mothers but couldn't get themselves to do that to someone who had carried them in the womb for nine months.\" They were tired of the advice and cautions, mostly from conservative or religious mothers who have always had a problem with their more liberal-minded children's lifestyles. Warnings, for example, signed by unknown medical experts, explaining how wearing thongs can cause cancer and how tight skirts can lead to heart attacks. And of the most implausible stories: All stories accompanied by videos and photos. Affordable internet access became common in Nigeria just a few years ago, so this generation of elderly Nigerians was hardly exposed to the wonders of Photoshop and the ingenuity of idle minds that invent stories just for fun and clicks. The Wuhan 'dragon' And so, they tend to believe most information they come across, especially when there is visual \"evidence\". \"My mother sent me and my siblings a video of a dragon-like creature fleeing towards the sky,\" said 40-year-old Grace, who lives in Lagos. \"She said we should see, that coronavirus was finally leaving the earth.\" More about fake news: Grace was shocked that her well-educated, 76-year-old mother could actually believe that the coronavirus was captured on camera, finally fleeing the Chinese city of Wuhan through the clouds and into the sky. \"She asked me how I knew that it wasn't true and I said: 'Mummy, the coronavirus is not a flying reptile!' \"She acknowledged that I was right and we just kind of laughed over it.\" Hardly any of the ongoing efforts here to combat fake news and improve digital literacy focus on older Nigerians - and so the burden must continue to rest on younger family members like Grace to correct and enlighten their parents. But, sometimes, even this is impossible. \"Sometimes when I correct her, my mother tells me that I'm being rude,\" said Udo. \"She complains that I'm being insulting.\" More Letters from Africa: Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica", "summary0": "In our series of letters from African writers, Nigerian novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani says children are now having to police their credulous parents on WhatsApp.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-52964917", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "'Yan shekarun da suka wuce, masu wasannin barkwanci na kwashe tsawon lokaci suna tsokana kan wata mahaifiya a Najeriya da kuma halayyarta ga wayar salula.

And they usually don't have a blocked, stuffy or runny nose - most people with coronavirus can still breathe freely. Another thing that sets them apart is their \"true\" loss of taste. It's not that their taste is somewhat impaired because their sense of smell is out of action, say the researchers in the journal Rhinology. Coronavirus patients with loss of taste really cannot tell the difference between bitter or sweet. Experts suspect this is because the pandemic virus affects the nerve cells directly involved with smell and taste sensation. The main symptoms of coronavirus are: Anyone with these symptoms should self-isolate and arrange to have a swab test to check if they have the virus. Members of their household should isolate too to prevent possible spread. Smell research Lead investigator Prof Carl Philpott, from the University of East Anglia, carried out smell and taste tests on 30 volunteers: 10 with Covid-19, 10 with bad colds and 10 healthy people with no cold or flu symptoms. Smell loss was much more profound in the Covid-19 patients. They were less able to identify smells, and they were not able to discern bitter or sweet tastes at all. Prof Philpott, who works with the charity Fifth Sense, which was set up to help with people with smell and taste disorders, said: \"There really do appear to be distinguishing features that set the coronavirus apart from other respiratory viruses. \"This is very exciting because it means that smell and taste tests could be used to discriminate between Covid-19 patients and people with a regular cold or flu.\" He said people could do their own smell and taste tests at home using products like coffee, garlic, oranges or lemons and sugar. He stressed that diagnostic throat and nose swab tests were still essential if someone thought they might have coronavirus. The senses of smell and taste return within a few weeks in most people who recover from coronavirus, he added. Prof Andrew Lane is an expert in nose and sinus problems at Johns Hopkins University in the US. He and his team have been studying tissue samples from the back of the nose to understand how coronavirus might cause loss of smell and have published the findings in the European Respiratory Journal. They identified extremely high levels of an enzyme which were present only in the area of the nose responsible for smelling. This enzyme, called ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II), is thought to be the \"entry point\" that allows coronavirus to get into the cells of the body and cause an infection. The nose is one of the places where Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters the body. Prof Lane said: \"We are now doing more experiments in the lab to see whether the virus is indeed using these cells to access and infect the body. \"If that's the case, we may be able to tackle the infection with antiviral therapies delivered directly through the nose.\"", "summary0": "The loss of smell that can accompany coronavirus is unique and different from that experienced by someone with a bad cold or flu, say European researchers who have studied the experiences of patients.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-54195122", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Lokacin da masu fama da cutar korona suka daina jin ƙamshi, lamarin na zuwa ne kwatsam kuma yana ta'azzara.

For the USB union, the decision means Fiat is missing out on investment. It said the firm needed to guarantee the future of thousands of people, \"rather than enriching only one\". The union added that it was \"unacceptable\" that while Fiat Chrysler workers were making \"huge economic sacrifices\", millions of euros were being spent on the purchase of a player. The four-year deal to woo Ronaldo from Real Madrid was announced on Tuesday amid concern that Juventus might have overpaid for the 33-year-old forward. However, football finance expert Rob Wilson, of Sheffield Hallam University, said Juventus should earn more than enough money from Ronaldo to cover the transfer fee and his wages. He added: \"The marketing leverage that Juventus will be able to create will be significant. Added to that the likelihood that he will strengthen the team, it seems plausible that they will be more successful domestically and qualify routinely for the Champions League. That means more sponsors, more TV money and more prize money.\" Born on the Portuguese island of Madeira, where the airport is named after him, Ronaldo has had a successful career at Real Madrid, scoring 450 goals in 438 games for the club. As captain of the Portuguese team in the 2018 World Cup, he scored four goals, including a hat-trick against Spain. Portugal made the last 16 of the tournament, in stark contrast to Italy, who failed to qualify for the first time since 1958. Limited impact Although Juventus and Fiat Chrysler are run as entirely separate businesses, they are both controlled by Exor, the investment holding of the Agnelli family. The USB union has called for a strike at the Melfi plant in southern Italy, which makes cars including the Fiat Punto and the 500X. Its members will walk out at 22:00 local time on Sunday and remain on strike until 18:00 on the following Tuesday. However, the impact of the stoppage is likely to be limited.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46864864", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Karenina Velandia and Charlie NewlandBBC News El Helicoide was once the symbol of a rich and promising nation. Today, it houses one of Venezuela's most infamous jails, and embodies the country's decline from Latin American powerhouse to crisis zone. 'Instant modernity' El Helicoide was built in the 1950s, when Venezuela had big dreams - and big money from oil revenues to match. The post-World War Two boom was in full swing and dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez wanted to project an image of a forward-looking nation. \"There was real investment in this idea of instant modernity,\" says Dr Lisa Blackmore, co-author of \"Downward Spiral: El Helicoide's Descent from Mall to Prison\" and director of Latin American Studies at the University of Essex in the UK. \"[Venezuela] is a country that from 1948 entered a period of military dictatorship, and the mandate was: 'We will progress if we build.'\" El Helicoide was supposed to be world's first drive-thru shopping centre, with ramps spiralling upwards to the 300 planned boutiques in the complex. It was so big it could be seen from anywhere in the city of Caracas. \"This is an absolutely iconic building - there is really nothing like it in Latin America,\" Dr Blackmore says. But Perez Jimenez was overthrown in 1958 and this ambitious project became a white elephant. Place of fear For years the building stood largely empty, but in the 1980s the government started to transfer some state agencies to El Helicoide - the most important being its intelligence services, now known as SEBIN. Since then it's become a place of fear, used to detain both ordinary criminals and political prisoners. The BBC has spoken to former prisoners, their families, legal representatives, NGOs, and also to two former prison guards to build up a picture of life in El Helicoide. They have asked us to protect their identities because they fear government reprisals against their families. Rosmit Mantilla arrived at El Helicoide in May 2014. He was one of more than 3,000 people arrested as huge anti-government protests rocked the country. Aged 32, he was already a well-known political activist and outspoken advocate of LGBT rights. During his incarceration he would also be elected to the Venezuelan National Assembly, becoming the country's first openly gay congressman. Economic and political turmoil Life in Venezuela was becoming increasingly difficult, with spiralling inflation, shortages of food and medicine, and public services nearing collapse. At El Helicoide, it was a chaotic time. Busloads of prisoners were arriving at the prison every day. Students, political activists, and sometimes people, including children, were swept up because they'd been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Mantilla was accused of helping finance the protests - a charge he denies. Manuel is a former prison officer who remembers Mantilla well. \"[He] was one of those detainees who should never have been there,\" Manuel remembers. 'Make people afraid' The former officer told the BBC: \"By arresting a lot of people, the aim was to make people afraid.\" \"And I think they did, in a way. Because nowadays, when there is a demonstration or a march, many Venezuelans are afraid because they don't want to be arrested.\" Prisoners in El Helicoide wait days, weeks, even months to appear before a tribunal. Manuel said: \"SEBIN is an institution whose mission is to produce intelligence and information. But for a while that has not been its role. Its role is to defend a regime, a dictatorship.\" During his two-and-a-half year nightmare, Mantilla says he was afraid all the time. But he felt driven to document the torture and cruelty which happened on a daily basis in El Helicoide. 'Guantanamo' When Mantilla arrived at El Helicoide in 2014, he recalls there were just 50 detainees. Two years later, he says, there were 300. As the number of detainees rose, the guards had to improvise to find more space. Offices, toilets, staircases and spaces once meant to be exclusive boutiques were sealed off and converted into cells. The prisoners had names for them - the Fish Tank, Little Tiger and Little Hell. But the worst of all was Guantanamo. \"It was an old evidence storeroom,\" remembers Victor, another former prison officer at El Helicoide. \"It was about 12 x 12 metres and it was used to hold around 50 prisoners.\" It was hot, cramped and airless. \"No light, no water, no toilet, without sanitation and without beds,\" says Mantilla. \"The walls were stained with blood and excrement.\" He told the BBC that prisoners could spend weeks there without showering, urinating in plastic bottles and defecating in plastic bags - which they'd refer to as 'little ships'. Systematic torture But mistreatment is not the only fear associated with El Helicoide. All the former prisoners and guards who have spoken to the BBC about their experiences have described the systematic use of torture by the SEBIN to obtain confessions. Carlos, a former detainee, told the BBC: \"They covered my head with a bag. I was badly beaten, kicked and subjected to electric shocks to my head, testicles and stomach.\" \"I felt immense humiliation, impotence, shame and indignation.\" Another detainee, Luis, said: \"My head was covered but I heard one SEBIN officer saying: \"Let's get the gun. We are going to kill you.\" \"They were laughing. \"There's one bullet. Let's see if you're lucky.\" I could feel the pistol against my head… and hear them pulling the trigger. It happened many times.\" Mantilla says he began to collect prisoners' stories and found the same brutal methods used over and over again. \"There was a university student who had a plastic bag full of human excrement forced over his head so he had to breathe it in,\" he told the BBC. \"I heard about people raped with blunt objects, others given electric shocks, and some were blindfolded for days until they would lose consciousness.\" Human rights abuses Both former guards who spoke to the BBC denied ever participating in torture themselves, but both say they had seen it happening. \"I saw people being beaten, tied up, suspended from a stair rail by their wrists with their feet barely touching the ground,\" says Victor. \"They used a battery charger with two wires connected to the detainees through their skin to give them electric shocks,\" says Manuel. \"[Torture] was systematic,\" he adds. \"It was seen as normal.\" Many of these cases have been documented by international human rights organisations, and in February 2018 the International Criminal Court opened a preliminary examination into crimes and human rights violations committed during the protests. Venezuela has said that it will cooperate with the investigation. Left to die In October 2016, after spending two-and-a-half years in El Helicoide, Mantilla became so seriously ill that the prison authorities decided to transfer him to a clinic to undergo surgery. The procedure was authorised by a judge, but at the last moment the SEBIN intervened. Still in chronic pain, Mantilla was dragged out of the clinic and forcibly returned to El Helicoide, where he was thrown into an isolation cell. \"It was like having a terminal disease and being locked in a room and told you will never be released. They were sentencing me to death.\" Video footage posted on the internet of Mantilla shouting defiantly as he was pushed into a SEBIN vehicle outside the clinic caused an outcry both at home and abroad. International humanitarian organisations led calls for his release. After ten days, the authorities bowed to pressure and Mantilla was transferred first to a military hospital, then to a clinic where he finally had the operation he needed. He was formally released from detention in November 2016, and within days was sworn in as a congressman - then he began testifying about what he had seen and experienced in El Helicoide. \"Crimes against humanity do not have an expiration date [statute of limitations],\" he says. Exile But Mantilla never felt safe after his release, and in July 2017, he left Venezuela and moved to France. He was granted asylum in May 2018. From his new home he still follows events in Venezuela closely, and hopes to return one day. His time in El Helicoide continues to cast a long shadow on his life. \"I never was the same person [afterwards]… It is complicated because somehow El Helicoide was my home for two and a half years. Although I try to deny it, a lot of me remains inside there.\" Manuel and Victor have also both left Venezuela and are living abroad. In May 2018, prisoners in El Helicoide rioted in protest at the conditions. A number of detainees were released and promises were made to improve conditions. But according to accounts from those who have been inside the prison, not much has been done to improve the conditions in El Helicoide. The BBC repeatedly contacted the Venezuelan authorities and put the allegations about El Helicoide to them. Despite repeated attempts to contact officials in the Ministry of Communications based in Caracas and to the representatives of the Venezuelan government in the UK the BBC has not received a response to these requests.

Prompting feverish speculation on social media has been the scathing set of interviews given to Al-Arabiya TV by former Saudi intelligence chief and longtime ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan al-Saud, who lambasted Palestinian leaders for criticising recent peace moves with Israel by Gulf Arab states. \"This low level of discourse is not what we expect from officials who seek to gain global support for their cause,\" said Prince Bandar in the three-part interview. \"Their [Palestinian leaders'] transgression against the Gulf states' leadership with this reprehensible discourse is entirely unacceptable.\" Palestinian leaders initially described the UAE and Bahrain's normalisation of relations with Israel as a \"betrayal\" and \"a stab in the back\". Prince Bandar, who spent a remarkable 22 years as Saudi ambassador to Washington and was so close to former US President George W Bush that he was often nicknamed Bandar Bin Bush, spoke of \"the historic failures\" of the Palestinian leadership. It had taken Saudi support for granted, he told his audience. Although he made a point of calling the Palestinian cause a \"just\" one, he placed equal blame on Israel and the Palestinian leadership for failing to reach a peace deal after so many years. How, he argued, referring to the split between the Palestinian Authority, which governs in the West Bank, and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which holds power in Gaza, can Palestinians possibly reach a fair deal when their leaders cannot even agree among themselves? Such words, said a Saudi official close to the ruling family, would not have been aired on Saudi-owned television without the prior approval of both King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. By choosing Prince Bandar, a veteran diplomat and longstanding pillar of the Saudi royal establishment to deliver them, said the official, it was the clearest sign yet that the Saudi leadership may be preparing its population for an eventual deal with Israel. Historical suspicions It does seem that both by Prince Bandar's words and by quietly endorsing the recent UAE and Bahraini normalisations with Israel, the Saudi leadership is moving rather faster towards rapprochement with Israel than much of its own population. For so many years, especially in the more rural, isolated corners of the kingdom, Saudis have been accustomed to viewing not just Israel as the enemy, but also all Jewish people. I remember in one mountain village in Asir province a Saudi telling me in all seriousness that \"on one day of the year Jews drink the blood of babies\". Thanks to the internet and satellite TV those kinds of conspiracy theories are rarer in the kingdom now; Saudis spend a huge amount of time online and are often better informed about world affairs than people in the West. Yet given the xenophobia and historical suspicion of outsiders that exist among certain parts of the Saudi population it will take time to turn around this metaphorical tanker in midstream, which is why Saudi Arabia has not rushed to follow its Gulf neighbours in forging a historic deal. Saddam calamity Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states' history of relations with the Palestinians is a chequered one. Gulf governments have nominally supported the Palestinian cause, both politically and financially, for decades. But when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sided with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein over his invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990 they felt an enormous sense of betrayal. After the US-led Operation Desert Storm and the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, that country expelled the entire expatriate community of Palestinians, replacing them with thousands of Egyptians. Visiting a traumatised Kuwait City that year, I noticed some Arabic graffiti scrawled on the side of an abandoned pizza restaurant. \"Al-Quds da'iman lil'Sihyouneen, w'ana Kuwaiti', it read. \"Jerusalem is the eternal home of the Zionists, and I'm a Kuwaiti [writing this]\". It took a long time for the region's older rulers to get over Arafat's \"betrayal\". Ironically perhaps, someone who did more than most to heal the rifts across the Arab world was Kuwait's own late Emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who died last month, aged 91. Saudi peace plan Saudi Arabia does have history when it comes to holding out an olive branch to Israel. In March 2002 I was at the Arab Summit in Beirut, where a slight, urbane, balding man with perfect English was doing the rounds, explaining something called the Crown Prince Abdullah Peace Plan. The man was Adel Jubair, then a foreign affairs adviser in the Crown Prince's Court, now Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs. The peace plan dominated the summit that year and it was unanimously endorsed by the Arab League. Essentially, it offered Israel full normalisation with the entire Arab world in exchange for a withdrawal from all occupied territories, including the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and Lebanon, as well as giving the Palestinians East Jerusalem as their capital and reaching a \"just solution\" for Palestinian refugees who, in the Arab-Israel war of 1948-49, had fled or been expelled from their homes in what became Israel. The plan received international support and it briefly put Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on the spot. Here, at last, seemed a chance to end once and for all the historic Arab-Israeli conflict. But just before the plan was published, Hamas bombed an Israeli hotel in Netanya, killing 30 people and wounding more than 100. All talk of peace was off the table. Fast forward 18 years and the Middle East has moved on in so many ways, although the Palestinians have yet to achieve independent statehood and Israeli settlements considered illegal under international law continue to encroach on Palestinian land in the West Bank. The UAE, Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt have now all made their peace with Israel and have full diplomatic relations. In fact, unlike the strained \"cold peace\" that Jordan and Egypt have with Israel, the two Gulf states are accelerating their ties with Israel. Within days of Bahrain signing the Abraham Accord at the White House, Israel's spy chiefs were visiting Manama, talking intelligence co-operation on their mutual adversary, Iran. Testing the water So how do Israeli officials feel about a potential future normalisation with Saudi Arabia? They have certainly watched Prince Bandar's interview with interest but have so far declined to comment directly. Instead, a spokesman for the Israeli embassy in London said: \"We hope that even more countries will recognise the new reality in the Middle East by joining us on the road to reconciliation.\" Saudi Arabia has traditionally moved slowly and with great caution when it comes to changes of policy, testing each move before committing itself. But the arrival on the scene of the maverick Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has changed all that. Women can now drive, there is public entertainment, and the country is slowly opening up to tourism. So a Saudi-Israeli peace deal, while not necessarily imminent, is now a real possibility.", "summary0": "Will they or won't they?

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52754782", "lang0": "english", "text0": "Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter On Friday, China said it wouldn't be setting a target for economic growth for this year. That's unprecedented - the Chinese government hasn't done this since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Abandoning the growth target is an acknowledgement of just how difficult a recovery in China will be in a post pandemic era. And while recent figures have shown that China is on the way out of its slowdown: it's an uneven recovery. First, the good news. For the first time since the pandemic hit China - factories are making goods again. Industrial output in April grew by a better-than-expected 3.9% - a marked difference from the collapse of 13.5% in the first two months of this year as massive lockdowns were imposed. There's also a swathe of other data that has been surprisingly strong - pointing to what economists like to call a V-shaped recovery - a sharp, drastic initial fall - followed by a quick rebound in economic activity. Coal consumption by six major power generators surged back to historical norms after May's \"Golden week\" holidays, according to investment bank JP Morgan. It currently stands 1.5% above the historical average, suggesting that power demand has returned to normal. And the pollution-free Chinese skies that we saw in the aftermath of the lockdowns there - well, they've disappeared as economic activity has picked up. China's air pollution levels recently surpassed concentrations over the same period last year for the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, driven by industrial emissions. All of this shows that China is slowly getting back to business. But it's not business as usual, and this shows just how difficult it will be for the rest of us to get our economies going again. Recent retail sales figures show just how difficult it is going to be to get people into shops and buying things. Sales were down 7.5% in April - better than March - but nowhere near where they need to be for the economy to be running on full cylinders. Many Chinese people are still worried about a second wave of infection, and they're not spending as much as they used to. It's no wonder China has abandoned it's growth target this year - the government knows it will be hard to forecast just how deep this crisis has become. Rising unemployment Compounding all of that - are the all-important unemployment figures - which officially came in slightly higher in April than in March, at 6%, edging closer to historical highs. But most economists say the real number is much worse. The \"true level of unemployment is likely double this\", given that around a fifth of migrant workers haven't returned to the cities, says the think tank Capital Economics. Even China's hard-line Communist mouthpiece the Global Times - typically the Chinese economy's biggest cheerleader - has pointed out how dire the employment picture is. It is saying that this year \"it will be nearly impossible for Chinese employees in the private sector to earn as much salary as they did in 2019,\" as small businesses have had to fire employees or cut staff. It's going to get worse before it gets better. Some 85% of private enterprises will struggle to survive over the next three months, writes Prof Justin Yifu Lin of Peking University, citing a Tsinghua University survey in March. \"Bankruptcy of enterprises will lead to an increase in unemployment,\" he adds. Granted, many Chinese people are employed by state-owned enterprises, and China's economic system is able to absorb the ranks of the unemployed better than the US. Chinese people have more savings, better family support, and many migrant workers also have land back home that they can rely on for basic needs and even sustenance in the very worst of circumstances. \"You will see a great transition of migrant workers going back to their villages where they have their own piece of land,\" Wang Huiyao of the Centre for China and Globalisation tells me. \"Yes, there will be some hardships, but people outside of China probably don't understand how we view hardships and difficulties - which Chinese people just experienced not too long ago when China was very poor. \" This time it's different The Communist Party has always stated a growth target to achieve as a way of signalling how well China is doing. But clearly this time it's different: no target - so there's no getting away from the fact that the current economic environment is the most challenging China has faced in recent years. Indeed, China has been through difficult economic periods before - the 1990s, for instance, saw huge numbers of people laid off. The economy at the time was dominated by state-owned enterprises - they provided jobs for the bulk of the working population. As the economy slowed down, they shed millions of workers - and unemployment rose rapidly, by one percentage point every year according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. State-owned enterprises went from employing 60% of the working population in 1995 to 30% in 2002. But China recovered, and the private sector stepped in to hire young people. This time, it's different and the private sector is also under pressure, says economist George Magnus, associate at the China Centre, Oxford University. \"No one was talking about trade wars at that time. The great offshoring of manufacturing to China was underway. \"Now, the rest of the world is an economic funk - so there's no consumer demand, and nothing in terms of foreign trade. All of the headwinds that China was facing before the pandemic have been compounded by the coronavirus.\" 'Chinese dream' under pressure For the last 40 years, China's Communist Party has been able to promise a simple contract to its citizens: we'll keep your quality of life improving and you fall in line so that we can keep China on the right path. It is the social contract that China's leader Xi Jinping crystallised as the \"Chinese dream\" when he announced it in 2012. 2020 was meant to be a pivotal part of that grand plan - the year China would eliminate absolute poverty, raising the quality and standard of life for millions of people. But the coronavirus could be putting that social contract at risk. Arguably more than any other economic crisis in the Chinese Communist Party's history, this health crisis has become a major threat for social stability in the country. Millions of young people may not be guaranteed the same degree of success that their parents' generation has seen. Keeping that contract of wealth, employment and stability is key to the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. Which is why economic recovery for China is so critical - and not having a growth target gives the government much needed flexibility to work out a plan.", "summary0": "While economists say China's economic data can't always be trusted, they now have a new dilemma - there is no data.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-52782091", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": ".

He said the task ahead of him at Dorados will be \"like carrying an elephant on our shoulders.\" The club are currently 13th in Mexico's second division, the Liga Ascenso. The team are without a win in the opening six games of the league. Despite this, Maradona said he would coach in an attacking manner, similar to how he played. \"We are going to look to win games, as I do not like to play defensive football,\" Maradona told his first press conference. He also acknowledged some of his past struggles. \"I had a lot of missteps in my life. I assume this responsibility like someone who holds a child in their arms,\" he said. \"When I took [drugs] ... It made me go backwards, it was a step back, and what football players have to do is go forward.\" The former Barcelona and Napoli forward previously managed UAE teams Al-Fujairah and Al-Wasl, along with the Argentina national team from 2008 to 2010. \"I am here to work. I am here to give my heart like I did in Fujairah, where I drove 300 kilometres a day to work,\" Maradona said. Although local media reported that residents of the wealthy neighbourhood where Maradona hopes to live have blocked his move, Dorados fans were largely supportive. \"We trust you, Diego. Here we don't criticise, we only admire,\" one fan's sign said. Mexico was the scene of Maradona's finest moment as a player, when he led his country to the 1986 World Cup title.

The woman's husband was able to save his sister but the others drowned. India has the highest number of recorded selfie deaths in the world. India accounted for about half of the 259 reported fatalities between 2011 and 2017, according to a study by the US National Library of Medicine. It was followed by Russia, the US and Pakistan. In Tamil Nadu on Sunday, the young married couple, from Bargur in Krishnagiri, were visiting relatives in Uthangarai along with the bridegroom's sister, The Hindu newspaper reported. The three entered the water together with three teenage siblings when one of them, a boy aged 14, slipped and dragged his two sisters aged 18 and 19 with him, along with the newly married woman and the bridegroom's sister. The sister was pulled to safety by her brother but the other four disappeared under the water. Police said the bodies were later recovered and that post-mortem examinations would be carried out. It was the latest in a series of tragedies linked to selfies in India. Experts have warned that people are taking unnecessary risks to impress their family and friends on social media. In Haryana state in May, three teenagers taking selfies on a railway track jumped out of the way when they saw a train approaching, only to be killed by another train coming in the other direction.

His son, Abdulaziz bin Fahad, was also removed as a deputy governor. The men, along with four other officials, face an investigation into \"suspicious financial dealings\" at the Ministry of Defence, the decree said. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is the king's son and is considered Saudi Arabia's de-facto ruler, has spearheaded a campaign against alleged corruption in the government. However, critics say the high-profile arrests have been aimed at removing obstacles to the prince's hold on power. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that three senior royals had been arrested, including the king's younger brother Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz and former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef. The most high-profile incident, in 2017, saw dozens of Saudi royal figures, ministers and businessmen detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. Most of them were later released, but only after reaching settlements worth a total of $106.7bn (£75.6bn) with the Saudi state. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 35, won international praise when he promised a series of economic and social reforms to the deeply-conservative country after coming to power in 2016. However he has been embroiled in a series of scandals, including the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in 2018 and an alleged murder plot against a former Saudi intelligence agent in Canada.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53305940", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Jiyar GolBBC Persian The group said it had attacked the major Iranian nuclear site at Natanz some two hours earlier, at 02:00 local time. In the detailed message, it claimed it had blown up a facility and that the Iranian regime would not be able to hide it. The group said it was composed of dissidents within Iran's military and security forces and that they had been behind numerous attacks that the Iranian authorities had so far concealed from the public. I went online to check Iranian news agencies and reliable accounts on social media, but I found no mention of such an attack anywhere. Several hours later, Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation announced there had been an incident at the Natanz nuclear plant, but they ruled out sabotage. The next day, Iran's Supreme National Security Council - its top security body - announced that it knew what caused the \"incident\" at Natanz but that \"for security reasons\" it would not for the time being say what this was. Nasa satellite images showed there had been a fire at Natanz at 02:06. The damage corresponded with details contained in the email from the Homeland Cheetahs. The group's message had been carefully crafted and included a propaganda video about attacks on strategic sites it said it had carried out inside Iran. Preparing this kind of statement and video requires hours, if not days, of planning. Whoever authored it knew about the Natanz explosion in advance, which supports the theory that it was an act of sabotage. But there is also the possibility that the email was an elaborate attempt to mislead us as to who was behind the attack, and could actually be the work of foreign agents posing as opponents of the regime in Iran. Attack 'thwarted' The group's name, the Homeland Cheetahs, is similar to those of other \"Iranian\" cyber groups, such as Persian Cat, or Charming Kitten - teams of hackers believed to be part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Cyber Army. It is possible that the Homeland Cheetahs were born to confront the Persian Cat. In late May, national cyber security in Israel - Iran's arch-foe - said the country had prevented a major cyber attack on its water system, widely thought to have been the work of Iran. Days later, there was a cyber attack on Shahid Rajaae, an important economic and shipping hub in southern Iran. More than 50% of Iran's sea imports and exports take place through this harbour. The attack caused a massive blockage of water in the canals and flooded roads leading to the terminal. Iranian officials blamed power shortages, but Western intelligence sources believe it was Israeli retaliation against Iran. Fires and blasts In the past three months there have been an increasing number of mysterious incidents which have damaged sensitive sites in Iran. Numerous fires have broken out in nuclear facilities, oil refineries, power plants, major factories and businesses across the country. Since 26 June alone, there have been several such incidents: Saeed Aganji, a Finland-based Iranian journalist who has been following the events, says the incidents are unusual and could be deliberate. \"By targeting Iran strategic and economic sites, the aim is to bring Iran's economy to its knees and force the regime to stop financing militia groups and change course in the Middle East.\" Parchin and Khojir are two military sites believed to house nuclear and missile production facilities on the eastern edge of Tehran. Inspectors from the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), have long been denied access to Parchin, where Iran is suspected of having conducted high-explosive tests related to the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Iran warning In a rare acknowledgement, Iran's state news agency Irna said the fire at Natanz could have been the result of sabotage \"by hostile countries, especially the Zionist regime [Israel] and the US\". Iran's civil defence chief has vowed to \"respond\" if it turns out Iran was the victim of a cyber attack. On Sunday, an unnamed \"Middle Eastern intelligence official\" told the New York Times Israel had caused the blast at Natanz. Just a day earlier, Israel's foreign minister responded obliquely when asked if Israel was behind the incident, saying \"our actions in Iran better left unsaid\". Israel does not normally take responsibility for these kinds of \"attacks\", and Iranian officials have avoided blaming Israel directly. But it seems the cyber war between the two countries has already started.", "summary0": "Just after midnight on 30 June, an email dropped into my inbox.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52979560", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Emma JonesEntertainment reporter The four-hour show, consisting of interviews given by Clinton to documentary maker Nanette Burstein, explores all of Hillary Rodham Clinton's life, from her activism in the 1960s, her marriage to ex-US President Bill Clinton, the Monica Lewinsky scandal and her unsuccessful attempt to become US President in 2016. Hillary puts forward the theory that the next generation of female leaders were galvanised by her election loss into standing for, and voting in, the Congress elections of 2018; with a record-breaking 103 women, including activists such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, elected or re-elected to the House of Representatives. \"I know what I mean to many women, I hear it almost every day, someone will say it to me,\" Clinton told BBC News. \"It's a heavy responsibility.\" \"I've tried to make my own decisions in keeping with who I am and what I stand for, but we still need role models, guides along the trail, 'if someone can do it then I can do it' - that sort of mentality. I'm very aware of it.\" Becoming documents former first lady Michelle Obama's recent international book tour, as well as her meeting young African American women to encourage them in their ambitions. According to the film's director, Nadia Hallgren, she had \"never seen anything like that energy before.\" \"What women seem to identify with,\" Hallgren adds, \"was just her stories of being told you can't do something or being constantly underestimated throughout life. This idea that if you're a woman, if you're not male, if you're not white, if you don't tick all these boxes, that you don't belong at that table. \"I think that there is a huge need and hunger worldwide for stories like hers. Hearing Mrs Obama talk about obstacles that she encountered throughout her life, and being able to reflect on the now, taught me so much about my own life and obstacles that I've encountered.\" Nanette Burstein, the director of Hillary, agrees that the visibility of the former first ladies is important, \"particularly for the young\". \"When I was in my 20s, and wanting to be a director, Secretary Clinton was just coming in as first lady - and as a very different first lady, one who would take on important initiatives such as healthcare. To me, as a young woman, that was very inspiring and life-changing. \"One of the reasons I said I'd tackle this story is so that people can understand what that means to a young woman.\" \"It's also joyous to know both these 'former first lady' films are being made by women,\" points out Mia Bays, the director of Birds Eye View, a not-for-profit organisation that centres on the female perspective in film. \"I think Becoming in particular helps us reflect on why Michelle Obama is such an inspirational figure and necessary for the world to lift even higher - especially right now.\" By contrast, for women, Hillary Clinton has historically been a more divisive figure - in 2016, the Edison National Election poll found that though overall 52% of women voters had chosen Clinton, 64% of non-college educated white women had voted for Donald Trump. Clinton says she's aware of the dislike she's provoked. \"It's wonderful to be liked, but if that's all you want, you're not there for the right reasons. There are scenes in this documentary I had forgotten. \"I am fighting for healthcare, and people were burning my effigy. People got really riled up about it, they disliked me and didn't like what I was doing. Often if you're not liked, it's because you're taking a stand. \"When a woman takes a very public stand in a controversial arena you just have to be prepared that you're going to be criticised and if you're not prepared, then don't do it,\" she says. \"I'm very proud of the work I have done and the stands I have taken, and I don't have any regrets about that.\" Clinton agrees that the documentary is a way of \"setting the record straight\". \"There is so much misinformation about me, so many ridiculous stories about me - to have my life portrayed in a way I recognise is quite a good step forward,\" she advocates. But can these kinds of documentaries ever be entirely impartial? Becoming was produced by the Obamas' production company Higher Ground. While Hillary was granted 35 hours of interviews with Clinton, so was Burstein ever going to be able to be critical? 'You can never rest' \"I understood that I could be criticised for how I portrayed this story,\" Nanette Burstein replies. \"I knew no matter what I did there would potentially be criticism. So I felt that I just needed to research as much as I could and be as honest as I could.\" Clinton is adamant that women continue to need positive encouragement into leadership - whether in the media, industry or in politics. \"I think by telling my story, you can see a lot of change, but you can see how reluctant it is and how much of a backlash there is,\" she says. \"You can never rest, and it gets exhausting to be honest. It's like, 'wait a minute, we knocked down that barrier and we repealed that law - why is this still so hard?' Why do people still not appreciate or respect the role and the opportunities women have to contribute? \"So you know, the struggle continues.\" All episodes of Hillary available from 11 June on Sky Documentaries and streaming service NowTV.

The animals can eat up to 200kg (440lb) of food a day. Thailand reported 127 new confirmed cases of the virus on Monday, bringing the country's recorded total to 1,651. Lek Chailert, founder of the Save Elephant Foundation, told the BBC: \"If there is no support forthcoming to keep them safe, these elephants, some of whom are pregnant, will either starve to death or may be put on to the streets to beg.\" Alternatively, some elephants may be sold to zoos or they may be returned to the illicit logging business, which officially banned the use of elephants in 1989. \"It's a very bleak outlook unless some financial help is received immediately,\" Lek Chailert adds. It's a challenge to keep the animals fed and healthy at the best of times but now it's the dry season, which makes the situation even more extreme. Kerri McCrea, who manages the Kindred Spirit Elephant Sanctuary in Mae Chaem, in northern Thailand, said the villagers who live near her had brought approximately 70 elephants back to her area because they were not receiving any money from tourism anymore. \"Feeding elephants is a priority but the issue is that there's not enough forest left to feed them,\" she explains. Ms McCrae, who originally comes from Northern Ireland and is also a co-founder of the sanctuary, has to drive up to three hours a day to find enough grasses and corn stalks to feed the five elephants in her care. She says local elephant caretakers are forced to do the same. The country, which normally relies on tourism for a large portion of its economic growth, has been forced to close its borders to all tourists and much of the country is in lockdown. Happy elephants, Kerri McCrae says, are usually swinging their tails or flapping their ears or even giving themselves dust baths to keep cool. But elephants get depressed when they're hungry, and none of that happy behaviour would be on display. \"The worst case scenario is that owners will have to chose between themselves and their elephants,\" Ms McCrae says. \"The people here don't have much, but they're doing what it takes to keep the elephants alive for now.\"", "summary0": "More than 1,000 elephants face starvation in Thailand because the coronavirus crisis has slashed revenue from tourism, conservationists say.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-52115463", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Giwaye na daukar hankali a wurin yawon bude ido a Thailand Rashin baki zai haifar da barazana ga masu kula da dabobbi da dama, da ke fafutukar ganin sun ciyar da giwayen Thailand 4,000 da ake garkame da su.

Local female lawyers suggest the measure will end what are known as secret divorces - cases where men end a marriage without telling their wives. The directive would ensure women are fully aware of their marital status and can protect rights such as alimony. Last year, a decades-old driving ban on women was lifted in Saudi Arabia. However, women still remain subject to male guardianship laws. \"The new measure ensures women get their [alimony] rights when they're divorced,\" Saudi lawyer Nisreen al-Ghamdi told Bloomberg. \"It also ensures that any powers of attorney issued before the divorce are not misused.\" Many women have filed appeals to courts over being divorced without their knowledge, lawyer Samia al-Hindi told local newspaper Okaz. The new step is said to be part of economic and social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, such as allowing women to attend football matches and work in jobs traditionally reserved for men. What can Saudi women still not do? There are many things that Saudi women are unable to do without permission from a male guardian, usually a husband, father, brother or son.

When I heard him say these words I felt sick to my stomach. I had already witnessed what he described - young Nigerians hooked on cough syrup made with codeine, an opioid which can be addictive. A 14-year-old girl from my home city of Lagos, her parents distressed and unsure how to help her. A young man in Kano, chained to the floor of a rehab centre, swarming with flies, driven mad by months of drinking syrup with his friends. My own brother has suffered from codeine cough syrup addiction. The strawberry tasting opioid hooked him after our father was killed. Grief, depression, a desire to be cool are just some of the reasons Nigerians are falling for this drug. Musicians sing about the high it gives you. Dealers peddle it in nightclubs and on the streets. Teenagers mix it with soft drinks, or swig it straight from the bottle at \"syrup parties\". Mr Hussan, aka Baba Ibeji, works at Bioraj Pharmaceuticals, a licensed medical producer which manufactures a codeine cough syrup called Biolin. The company is a major supplier to northern Nigeria. He is one of a number of pharmaceutical company employees who the BBC have secretly filmed doing illegal cough syrup deals over the past few months. It is not illegal to drink or manufacture the medicine - but it is against the law to sell it to people without a doctor's prescription or those who don't have a pharmaceutical licence. \"Even if someone wants to buy 1,000 cartons, we won't give them a receipt,\" Mr Hassan told us, explaining how he avoids detection from authorities. Corruption like this is against Bioraj company policy, but is helping to fuel the industrial quantities of syrup leaking on to the black market. When we informed Bioraj that we had evidence Mr Hassan was engaging in this illicit activity, it responded with a statement saying the company only sells codeine cough syrup legitimately, that Mr Hassan denies wrongdoing, and that company chairman Bioku Rahamon personally guards Biolin sales. Like all opioids, codeine is in the same chemical family as heroin. It's an effective painkiller, but is also capable of giving you a euphoric high if consumed in large quantities. It is highly addictive and, taken in excess, can have a devastating impact on the mind and body. In the Dorayi Rehabilitation Centre in Kano, I met a man said by staff to have been driven insane by the drug. He was shackled at the ankles and chained to the roots of a tree, screaming and thrashing his arms. Seventy-two hours earlier he had been out on the streets, breaking car windows in traffic. \"He's still going through his withdrawal issues now,\" said Sani Usaini, the officer in charge of the rehab centre. Codeine cough syrup - the scale of the problem In addition to kidney damage and seizures, serious abuse of codeine cough syrup can trigger mental psychosis - delusions, hallucinations, and even schizophrenia. Many of the syrup addicts in the rehab centre can become so violent that staff chain them to the floor. \"He can't be in a bed because he has broken the bed, he has broken the windows and hurt himself,\" Mr Usaini told me, as I stood in front of another shackled young man. The air hung with a faint smell of faeces and the hum of flies. \"Plenty of parents come here to cry.\" Pharmaceutical company employees who illegally sell syrup on to the black market know just how addictive codeine can be. Among them is Chukwunonye Madubuike, a business development executive with Emzor pharmaceuticals, which illegally sold us 60 bottles of codeine syrup in a hotel room deal in Lagos. \"When somebody is addicted to something - you get me? - and he needs it, the price I don't think is an issue on this,\" he told us. \"This is a product that I know that if I have one million cartons, I can sell it in a week.\" Emzor Pharmaceuticals told us that it is now investigating Mr Madubuike, adding he has access to a very limited amount of Emzolyn with codeine and could not sell large quantities illegally. The company says it is a responsible and compliant business, is reviewing its distribution policies, and treating our findings with the utmost seriousness. 'It crosses all class' In Kano, northern Nigeria, the drug enforcement agency (NDLEA) regularly leads raids to seize and destroy codeine syrup destined for street sale. Officers showed us over two tonnes of syrup - Bioraj's Biolin with codeine - that had been seized by Swat teams. They also showed us weapons criminal drug gangs use to protect their business, including knives, swords, and even a chainsaw that had been used to attack an NDLEA officer. But the NDLEA in Kano, by its own admission, is struggling to cope with the sheer scale of the syrup epidemic. The Nigerian Senate estimates that as many as three million bottles of codeine syrup are drunk every single day in just two states, Kano and Jigawa. \"We may not even arrest 10% [of cough syrup on the market],\" said Commander Hamza Umar of the NDLEA in Kano. \"It crosses all class, no matter the level - rich and poor, educated and illiterate, a beggar and a toddler.\" Back in the rehab centre, Mr Usaini measures the scale of the epidemic by the number of young syrup addicts who are brought into his care. He used to see perhaps two or three cases each week, but \"now we see seven, eight, sometimes even 10 within a week… Any child that you see they're bringing here as a drug addict? It's codeine.\" In a windowless room, still shaking after two months of withdrawal, we found one of those children - a 16-year-old girl in a pink hijab who told us that she used to get syrup from her boyfriend and drink it after school. She had a simple message for other young Nigerians tempted by the syrup craze: \"I would advise them not to go into it if they haven't already. If they do, it will ruin their lives.\" This is the first report from BBC Africa's new investigations unit, Africa Eye.", "summary0": "When the younger brother of the BBC's Ruona Meyer became addicted to cough syrup, she began to investigate the men who make and sell opioid-based medicine on the streets of Lagos.

Last month, the Hague-based court ruled that it could exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the territories. Israel rejected Ms Bensouda's decision, while Palestinian officials praised it. The US expressed disappointment and opposition to the move. The ICC has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the territory of states party to the Rome Statute, its founding treaty. Israel has never ratified the Rome Statute, but the court ruled that it had jurisdiction because the United Nations secretary general accepted the Palestinians' accession to the treaty in 2015. Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians claim the territories for a future independent state. What prompted the prosecutor's decision? In a statement issued on Wednesday, Ms Bensouda explained that her office was obliged to act \"where a state party has referred a situation\" to it and \"it is determined that a reasonable basis exists to commence an investigation\". Ms Bensouda said she had carried out a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" that lasted close to five years and promised that the investigation would be conducted independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour. \"We have no agenda other than to meet our statutory duties under the Rome Statute with professional integrity,\" she said, noting that she had declined to investigate the 2010 killing by Israeli troops of 10 Turkish activists on the Gaza-bound ship Mavi Marmara. \"In the current situation, however, there is a reasonable basis to proceed and there are admissible potential cases,\" she added. Ms Bensouda, who will be succeeded by British prosecutor Karim Khan in June, also stressed that the \"central concern must be for the victims of crimes, both Palestinian and Israeli, arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides\". The prosecutor's decision came moments before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's glitzy online election campaign launch. He used the stage to give an excoriating response, saying the probe was an anti-Semitic attack on the only Jewish state. This approach will continue in public - to undermine the court itself. Behind the scenes though, concerned officials are working to offset, delay and limit its impact. They will try to show that Israel can investigate itself and that an outgoing prosecutor is tying her successor's hands. They will roll out a plan - understood to be no-expense-spared - to minimise the chance of any future arrest of officers or politicians abroad. Israel's defence minister has acknowledged that \"hundreds\", including himself, could be at risk, adding: \"We will take care of everybody.\" And they will rely on the US and other allies for backing. But the level of rhetoric suggests Israel's leadership feels increasingly worried by the progress of the case. What has been the reaction? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ICC's decision was \"the essence of anti-Semitism and the essence of hypocrisy.\" \"It found that our brave and moral soldiers, who are fighting the most brutal terrorists on earth, are, of all people, war criminals.\" \"The court, which was established to prevent a recurrence of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish people, is now turning against the state of the Jewish people,\" he asserted. US State Department spokesman Ned Price criticised the decision. \"We firmly oppose and are disappointed by the ICC prosecutor's announcement of an investigation into the Palestinian situation,\" he said, adding the US \"will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly\". Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said: \"The crimes committed by the leaders of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people - which are ongoing, systematic and widespread - make this investigation necessary and urgent.\" The militant Hamas movement, which controls Gaza, welcomed the decision as \"step forward on the path of achieving justice\", while also defending its actions as \"legitimate resistance\". Campaign group Human Rights Watch said \"all eyes\" would be on incoming prosecutor Karim Khan to \"pick up the baton\", and that \"ICC member countries should stand ready to fiercely protect the court's work from any political pressure\". What alleged crimes are being investigated? Ms Bensouda's preliminary examination is believed to have focused on issues such as Israeli military operations in Gaza and the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank - which most of the international community consider illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. When the Palestinians asked to accede to the Rome Statute, they recognised ICC jurisdiction for the purpose of prosecuting alleged perpetrators of crimes from 13 June 2014 onwards. That is one month before a war erupted between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. In the fighting, 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed while on the Israeli side 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed. Following the preliminary examination, Ms Bensouda said there was a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed in the context of the war, and that charges could be filed against Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel and members of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. The prosecutor also concluded that there was a reasonable basis to believe that in the context of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, members of the Israeli authorities had committed war crimes.", "summary0": "The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has opened a formal investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-56275368", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Kotun ta ICC ta yanke hukunci a watan jiya cewa tana iya yanke da hukunci kan yankunan Falasdinawa Fatou Bensouda ta ce binciken zai duba abubuwan da su ka faru a yankuna kamar na Yamma da Kogin Jordan da Isra'ilar ta mamaye da Gabashin Jerusalem da kuma Zirin Gaza tun 2014.

Doctors found she was still pregnant with twins in a second uterus, and performed an emergency Caesarean. Her twins were found to be healthy and were discharged with no complications. 'We were shocked' Ms Sultana, who is from a rural village, delivered her first baby at the Khulna Medical College Hospital in Khulna district. Just 26 days later, she complained of stomach pain and was rushed to the Ad-din Hospital in Jessore district on 21 March, Dr Sheila Poddar, the gynaecologist who performed the Caesarean told the BBC. Some media reports put the date as 22 March. \"When the patient came in we performed an ultrasound on her and found there were twin babies,\" Dr Poddar said. \"We were very shocked and surprised. I have never observed something like this before.\" It is unclear why she might have chosen to go to a different hospital. According to Dr Poddar, Ms Sultana and her husband are \"very poor\" and she had \"never had an ultrasound before\", in the run up to her first delivery. \"She had no idea that she had two other babies,\" said Dr Poddar. \"We carried out a caesarean and she delivered twins, one male and female.\" The 20-year-old and her newborns were discharged on 25 March after four days in hospital. \"The babies and her are all healthy. I am very, very happy that everything went well,\" Dr Poddar said. One gynaecologist in Singapore said uterus didelphys - the condition of having two uteruses - is \"not as rare as people think\". \"If you go for a scan beforehand it would be very obvious to see two sets of uteruses. But obviously they are from a more rural area [and might not have access to ultrasound scanning],\" Dr Christopher Ng of the GynaeMD Clinic told the BBC. \"[It's likely that] three eggs ovulated and were fertilised at the same time during her fertile period which resulted in three embryos.\" What is uterus didelphys? It is a disorder in which a female develops a double uterus instead of one. The uterus starts out as two small tubes in a foetus and these normally join together to form one large organ - but if they don't a double uterus may be formed. Such abnormalities vary in severity and in some cases can cause fertility problems. There are varying estimates as to how common the condition is. It is thought to affect about one in 1,000 women in the UK. Often women who have the condition do not have symptoms and it is usually discovered during pregnancy when an ultrasound scan is given. Ms Sultana said she was happy with her children but was concerned that raising them would put a strain on her financial situation, according to AFP news agency. Her husband earns less than 6,000 taka (£53; $69) a month as a labourer, but he said he would \"try his best\", AFP reported. \"It was a miracle from Allah that all my children are healthy. I will try my best to keep them happy.\" Reporting by the BBC's Yvette Tan", "summary0": "A Bangladeshi woman has given birth to twins almost one month after delivering a premature baby boy, her doctor told the BBC.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-47733733", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Sultana ba ta san cewa tana dauke da cikin 'yan uku ba ne Arifa Sultana, mai shekara 20, ta haifi dan nata ne a karshen watan Fabrairu, amma bayan kwana 26 sai aka sake garzayawa da ita asibiti bayan da ta yi korafin cewa tana fama da ciwon ciki.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/57170576", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Jake HortonBBC Reality Check Senator Bernie Sanders has said the US must take a \"hard look\" at how the money is spent. So what does Israel get and what is it used for? How much aid does the US give? In 2020, the US gave $3.8bn (£2.7bn) in aid to Israel - part of a long-term, yearly commitment made under the Obama administration. Almost all of this aid was for military assistance. This support came as part of an agreement signed by former president Barack Obama in 2016 for an overall package of $38bn (26.8bn) in military aid over the decade 2017-2028. This represents an increase of about 6% (adjusted for inflation) over the spending commitment for the previous decade. On top of this, last year the US gave $5m (£3.5m) toward resettling migrants in Israel. The country has a long-standing policy of accepting Jews from other parts of the world as citizens. How has Israel used US money? Over the years, US aid has helped Israel develop one of the most advanced militaries in the world, with the funds allowing them to purchase sophisticated military equipment from the US. For example, Israel has purchased 50 F-35 combat aircraft, which can be used for missile attacks - 27 of the aircraft have so far been delivered, costing around $100m (£70.4m) each. Last year Israel also bought eight KC-46A Boeing 'Pegasus' aircrafts for an estimated $2.4bn (£1.7bn). These are capable of refuelling planes such as the F-35 in mid-air. Of the $3.8bn given to Israel in 2020, $500m (£353.9m) was for missile defence, including investments in Israel's Iron Dome and other systems which can intercept incoming rockets. Since 2011, the US has contributed a total of $1.6bn (£1.1bn) to the Iron Dome defence system. In addition, Israel has spent millions collaborating with the US on developing military technology, such as a system to detect underground tunnels used to infiltrate Israel. The Israeli government invests heavily in military equipment and training, using the aid to compensate for being smaller than many other regional powers. How does this compare with other countries? Since World War Two, Israel has been the largest overall recipient of US foreign aid. In 2019, the most recent year to publish fully reported figures, Israel was the second highest recipient of US foreign aid after Afghanistan, according to USAID. A lot of the money given to Afghanistan has gone towards supporting the US military's efforts to stabilise the country, which has been engulfed by war since the US invasion in 2001. But with US troops set to leave Afghanistan by September this year, only about $370m (£261m) has been requested for 2021. Israel receives by far the most money in the Middle East. Egypt and Jordan are also major recipients of US aid. Both have their own peace deals with Israel, having once fought wars with it. They each received around $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worth of US aid in 2019. Meanwhile, President Biden has restored some funding ($235m) for the UN agency which helps Palestinian refugees. This funding was cut by the Trump administration in 2018. Why does the US give Israel so much aid? There are a number of reasons why the US gives so much aid to Israel, including historic commitments dating back to US support for the creation of the Jewish state in 1948. Moreover, Israel is seen by the US as a crucial ally in the Middle East - with shared goals and a mutual commitment to democratic values. The US Congressional Research Service says: \"US foreign aid has been a major component in cementing and reinforcing these ties. \"US officials and many lawmakers have long considered Israel to be a vital partner in the region.\" The US government's foreign assistance agency says: \"US assistance helps ensure that Israel maintains its Qualitative Military Edge (QME) over potential regional threats.\" It also states: \"US assistance... is aimed at ensuring that Israel is sufficiently secure to take the historic steps necessary to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians and for comprehensive regional peace.\" Ensuring Israel can defend itself against threats in the region has been cornerstone of US foreign policy for both Democratic and Republican presidents for decades. The 2020 Democrat party election platform expressed \"ironclad support\" for Israel, but some on the left of the party are now questioning the US aid commitment. Senator Sanders and other Democrats have moved to try to halt the planned sale of $735m (£518m) worth of precision-guided weapons to Israel.", "summary0": "President Joe Biden is facing questions from some in his Democratic party about the amount of aid the US sends to Israel.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/rahotanni-57227009", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Sanata Bernie Sanders ya ce dole ne Amurka ta yi zurfin tunani kan yadda ake kashe kuɗin.

But the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) says this sighting raises hopes that the animals at risk of extinction are actually reproducing. A number of infant gorillas are visible in the shots taken earlier this year. WCS in Nigeria, an international non-governmental organisation, said the pictures were captured by camera traps in the Mbe mountains. 'Wary of humans' Cross River gorillas are the world's rarest great ape, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says.

She was trying to head to Australia via a connecting flight in Bangkok. She told the BBC that she had renounced Islam, and feared she would be forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia and killed by her family. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Ms Mohammed al-Qunun is frightened and confused. She says she has an Australian visa but her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight at Suvarnabhumi airport. A Saudi envoy in Bangkok denied any official Saudi involvement in Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's detention. \"The embassy does not have the authority to arrest (anyone) at the airport or elsewhere,\" Abdellilah al-Shaayibi told news website Sabq. \"She was stopped by airport authorities because she violated Thai laws\". Thai police Maj Gen Surachate Hakparn told the BBC that Ms Mohammed al-Qunun was escaping a marriage. Because she did not have a visa to enter Thailand, he said police had denied her entry and were in the process of repatriating her through the same airline she had taken, Kuwait Airways, by Monday morning. Gen Surachate said he was unaware of any passport seizure. He told AFP the case was a \"family problem\" and the teenager \"had no further documents such as [a] return ticket or money\". However, Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told the BBC: \"It seems that the Thai government is manufacturing a story that she tried to apply for a visa and it was denied... in fact, she had an onward ticket to go to Australia, she didn't want to enter Thailand in the first place.\" He argued that the Thai authorities had clearly co-operated with Saudi Arabia as Saudi officials were able to met the plane when it arrived. Ms Mohammed al-Qunun told BBC Newshour she was now in a hotel in the transit area. She said: \"I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want.\" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun wrote on Twitter that she had decided to share her name and details because she had \"nothing to lose\" now. She also shared a picture of her passport \"because I want you to know I'm real and exist\". Another tweet read: \"I'm afraid my family will kill me.\" The case echoes that of another Saudi woman who was in transit to Australia in April 2017. Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, was en route from Kuwait via the Philippines but was taken back to Saudi Arabia from Manila airport by her family. She used a Canadian tourist's phone to send a message, a video of which was posted to Twitter, saying her family would kill her.

This can leave people coughing, wheezing and gasping for breath. The charity's #Scarfie campaign says \"a scarf can save a life\" but it's not a replacement for asthma medicines. Four million people with asthma in the UK say that breathing in cold winter air makes their asthma symptoms worse. Ethan Jennings, who is nearly four, and from Lancashire, has had severe asthma symptoms since he was a baby. In one year, he was rushed to hospital 17 times for treatment.

He ended up thousands of kilometres away near Guam, where he was eventually picked up by a Panamanian vessel. The 18-year-old, from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, worked on a \"rompong\" - a floating fish trap without any paddles or engine. His job had been to light the rompong's lamps, which are designed to attract fish, the Jakarta Post newspaper reports. The trap, which is shaped like a hut, floats in the middle of the sea but is anchored to the seabed by ropes. Every week, the teenager would be brought fresh supplies of food, water and fuel by someone from his company who would come to collect the fish. 'He often cried' On 14 July, Mr Adilang's rompong was hit by heavy winds, which caused its moorings to snap. He only had a limited amount of supplies left, so he caught fish and cooked it by burning the rompong's wooden fences. It is unclear how he remained hydrated. \"[He] said he had been scared and often cried while adrift,\" Fajar Firdaus, an Indonesian diplomat in Osaka, Japan, told The Jakarta Post. \"Every time he saw a large ship, he said, he was hopeful, but more than 10 ships had sailed past him. None of them stopped or saw [him].\" His mother told the news agency AFP how she learned of her son's disappearance. \"His boss told my husband that he went missing,\" Net Kahiking said. \"So we just surrendered to God and kept praying hard.\" On 31 August, Mr Adilang sent an emergency radio signal upon seeing the MV Arpeggio nearby. He was picked up by the Panamanian vessel off the waters of Guam. The captain of the vessel contacted the Guam coast guard, who instructed the crew to take him to Japan, the ship's destination, according to a statement from the Indonesian Consulate General in Osaka's Facebook page. Mr Adilang arrived in Japan on 6 September and flew back to Indonesia two days later, where he has now been reunited with his family. He is said to be in good health. \"He is now back at home and he will be 19 on September 30 - we're going to celebrate,\" his mother said.

{"num_docs": 2, "url0": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54904874", "lang0": "english", "text0": "By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent That was eight days ago, when we still did not know who would be in the White House in January. When Joe Biden was declared the winner, the Saudi leadership in Riyadh took rather longer to respond than they did when Donald Trump was elected. This is hardly surprising: they had just lost a friend at the top table. Mr Biden's victory could now have far-reaching consequences for Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf Arab states. The US strategic partnership with the region goes back to 1945 and it will likely endure, but changes are coming and they will not all be welcome in Gulf capitals. Losing a major ally President Trump was a massive ally and supporter of Saudi Arabia's ruling Saud family. He chose Riyadh as the destination for his first foreign presidential visit after taking office in 2017. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, formed a close working relationship with the all-powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. When every major Western intelligence agency suspected the crown prince of being behind the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, President Trump refused to blame him outright. Little wonder that MBS's team told people in the days immediately afterwards: \"Don't worry, we've got this.\" Mr Trump also resisted strident calls in Congress to curb arms sales to the Saudis. So Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, are about to lose a major ally in the White House. Plenty of things will not change but here is a look at some of the things that are likely to. The Yemen war President Barack Obama, under whom Mr Biden served as vice-president for eight years, was increasingly uncomfortable about Saudi Arabia's conduct of the war against Yemen's Houthi rebels. By the time he left office, the air war had been going for almost two years with little military success while inflicting enormous damage on civilians and the country's infrastructure. Alert to the war's unpopularity on Capitol Hill, President Obama cut back on US military and intelligence aid to the Saudi war machine. The Trump administration reversed that move and effectively gave the Saudis a free hand in Yemen. Now it looks set to flip back again, with Mr Biden recently telling the Council on Foreign Relations that he would \"end US support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen and order a reassessment of our relationship with Saudi Arabia\". Pressure from an incoming Biden administration on the Saudis and their Yemeni allies to settle this conflict is now likely to increase. The Saudis, and the Emiratis, realised some time ago this was never going to end in a military victory and have themselves been looking for a face-saving exit that does not leave the Houthis in exactly the same place they were when the air war started in March 2015. Iran President Obama's one big legacy in the Middle East was the hard-won Iran nuclear deal - the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). This lifted sanctions on Iran in return for strict compliance with limits on its nuclear activities and inspections of its nuclear facilities. President Trump called it \"the worst deal ever\" and pulled the US out of it. Now, his successor looks set to take the US back into the agreement in some form. This appals the Saudis. In Riyadh last autumn, shortly after the mysterious missile attacks on Saudi Arabia's petrochemical plants, I attended a press conference by the kingdom's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, who lambasted the Iran nuclear deal. It was disastrous, he said, as it did not take into account (it was never meant to) Iran's expansive strategic missile programme nor the proliferation of its proxy militias across the Middle East. The whole deal, he implied, was part of the flawed legacy of an Obama administration that had not appreciated the extent of the danger posed by the Islamic Republic. The Saudis and some of their Gulf allies quietly applauded when in January this year the US carried out a drone strike in Iraq that assassinated Gen Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations arm, the Quds Force. Now they worry whether the incoming White House team will be tempted to make a bargain with Tehran that undercuts their own interests. Qatar Qatar is home to the Pentagon's largest and most strategically important base in the Middle East: Al-Udeid Air Base. From there, the US directs all its air operations in the Central Command region, from Syria to Afghanistan. And yet Qatar is still under a damaging boycott from a quartet of Arab states - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt - who are all furious at its support for political Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood. The boycott began shortly after President Trump's much-trumpeted visit to Riyadh in 2017, and the quartet clearly thought they had his backing. In fact, Mr Trump initially and briefly supported it publicly until it was explained to him that Qatar was also a US ally and that Al-Udaid was rather important to the US defence department. President-elect Biden's administration is likely to push for this inter-Gulf rift to be healed. It has not been in the interest of the US, and it certainly has not been in the interests of the Gulf Arab states themselves. Human rights Several of the Gulf states have poor human rights records. But President Trump never showed much interest in castigating his Arab allies on the issue. He argued that US strategic interests and business deals overrode any concerns about imprisoned women's rights campaigners; the alleged abuse of foreign labourers in Qatar; or the fact that in October 2018 Saudi government security men flew in official planes to Istanbul to carry out a pre-planned operation to silence Saudi Arabia's most vocal critic, Jamal Khashoggi, disposing of his body which has never been found to this day. President-elect Biden and his administration are unlikely to be so forgiving.", "summary0": "\"You'll have to forgive me if I seem a little distracted,\" said the Saudi ambassador to the UK as his eyes flicked towards his mobile phone. \"I'm keeping an eye on the results coming in from Wisconsin.\"", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/rahotanni-54919931", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Yarima mai jiran gadon Saudiyya Mohammed bin Salman da takwaransa na Daular Larabawa manyan aminnan Trump ne Kwanaki takwas kenan da suka gabata, lokacin da ba mu san wa zai kasance a Fadar White House ba a watan Janairu.

The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the mountainous region, has vowed to keep fighting. The conflict has reportedly killed hundreds and displaced thousands in recent weeks. The UN has warned it could trigger a humanitarian crisis. Earlier the Ethiopian military warned Mekelle's 500,000 residents that the army would \"encircle\" the city and attack it with artillery fire. \"There will be no mercy,\" a spokesman said. TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters news agency that his forces had managed to stall advancing federal troops. \"They [are] sending waves after waves but to no avail,\" he told Reuters news agency. What is the government planning? The government said its troops took over some key towns last week. However, information is difficult to confirm and claims cannot be independently verified because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict. In a statement on Sunday aimed at the TPLF leadership, Mr Abiy said: \"Your journey of destruction is coming to an end, and we urge you to surrender peacefully within the next 72 hours, recognising you are at a point of no return. Take this last opportunity.\" Mr Abiy said TPLF forces should \"surrender peacefully\" and that the population of Mekelle should support government forces \"in bringing this treasonous group to justice\". On Friday, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the African Union chairman, announced the appointment of three former presidents to broker talks to end the conflict. But Ethiopia has rejected the offer because it sees the operation as an internal \"law enforcement\" mission. \"We don't negotiate with criminals... We bring them to justice, not to the negotiating table,\" Mamo Mihretu, a senior aide to Mr Abiy, told the BBC. \"Our African brothers and sisters would play a more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender and for that, you know, nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that point clear to them.\" Mr Mamo said that former leaders from Mozambique, Liberia, and South Africa - who are due to arrive in the country in the coming days - would not be able to visit Tigray because of the ongoing military operation. Communication and transport services has been severely hampered since fighting broke out. Mr Mamo said that the government was doing its \"utmost\" to allow UN agencies to provide assistance to people in Tigray. What is the fighting about? The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government. When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tensions escalated. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate. On 4 November the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle. The TPLF has rejected the claims. Its fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number 250,000. How bad is the situation? Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November. At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed into Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues. On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused. But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops. Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries. Many of the refugees arriving in Sudan are believed to be children. Aid agencies say an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia. Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals. Five things about Tigray: 1. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region. Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires. 2. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site. The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant. 3. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years. 4. The region's main language is Tigrinya, a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide. 5. Sesame is a major cash crop, exported to the US, China and other countries.", "summary0": "Ethiopia's prime minister has given forces in the northern region of Tigray 72 hours to surrender as government troops advance on the capital, Mekelle.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-55039140", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Rikicin ya yi sanadin rasa rayukan daruruwan fararen hula tare da raba dubbai da muhallansu Abiy Ahmed, ya shaida wa shugabannin Tigray cewa \"an shiga yanayin da babu zancen juya baya\".

Opposition calls for a re-run of the presidential election were rejected by the Constitutional Council last week. Riot police were deployed on Sunday to the major cities of Yaoundé and Douala in case of opposition protests. Cameroon's two English-speaking provinces have been hit by more than a year of violent protests and attacks by separatist rebels which have left hundreds dead. Two days before results were announced, Africa's longest-serving President Teodoro Obiang Nguema of neighbouring Equatorial Guinea congratulated Mr Biya on his win. Mr Biya's nearest challenger, Maurice Kamto of the MRC/CRM, gained just 14.2%. Mr Biya took the majority of votes in all but one of Cameroon's 10 regions, losing out to Mr Kamto by a small margin in the Littoral region which is home to the economic capital, Douala. Across the country, only half of Cameroon's voting-age population took part in the polls. Tens of thousands of people were unable to cast their votes because of insecurity. Threats of violence made against would-be voters by rebels in the Anglophone regions reportedly deterred many from casting their ballot. On election day, three separatists who were accused of opening fire on passers-by were shot dead by security forces. Some rebels also tried to disrupt the transporting of ballot boxes by calling for a total ban on all travel. Voter turnout in the country's two Anglophone regions was as low as 5%, according to the International Crisis Group. Official figures give an almost 16% turnout in the English-speaking South-West region. Witnesses have told AFP news agency they heard gunfire on Monday morning in Buea, the capital of the English-speaking South-West region. Cameroon's electoral body Elecam also reduced the overall number of polling stations across the Anglophone North-West and South-West regions, and moved some others from turbulent zones to more secure areas. Seats reserved for opposition representatives at the constitutional council were left empty as the results of the 7 October presidential election were read out, the BBC's Randy Joe Sa'ah reports from Yaoundé. In the days before the results were published 18 petitions calling for the election to be re-run were lodged by opposition members, some alleging fraud, at the Constitutional Court, the body responsible for announcing the results, before the results were announced. Among those calling for a fresh vote were President Biya's two main challengers - Mr Kamto and Joshua Osih of the main opposition SDF/FSD. Mr Kamto went as far as declaring himself the winner of the polls despite producing no evidence to prove this. Election observers from the African Union reported that the polls were \"generally peaceful\" but added that \"most parties were not represented\" when it came to who was allowed to oversee voting and ballot counts at polling stations. The only other group to send monitors was the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), whose head urged candidates and stakeholders to do their part in preserving peace and use legal channels in any challenges to the results (in French). False claims were made on Cameroon's state-owned television that Transparency International had deployed international observers, forcing the Germany-based campaign group to issue a statement denying them. Cameroon's parliamentary and legislative elections were due to take place at the same time as the 7 October presidential elections but have been postponed to 2019.", "summary0": "Cameroon's President Paul Biya has won a seventh term in office in polls marred by low turnout and voter intimidation.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-45942363", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Tun shekarar 1982 Shugaba Biya mai shekara 85 yake mulkin Kamaru Mista Biya mai shekara 85, wanda shi ne shugaban kasar da ya fi tsufa a Afirka, ya lashe zaben ne da kashi 71.3 cikin 100, a cewar sakamakon da jami'ai suka fitar.

The World Bank warned of “substantially higher risk” among households that depend on industries particularly vulnerable to the impact of the virus. These include tourism in Thailand and the Pacific Islands, along with manufacturing in Vietnam and Cambodia. The bank urged the region to invest in expanding healthcare and medical equipment factories, and to offer subsidies for sick pay that would help with containment and aid households. In its baseline scenario, almost 24 million fewer people will escape poverty across the region in 2020 due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Under its worst-case scenario, the bank predicts that almost 35 million people would be expected to remain in poverty, including 25 million in China. It defines the poverty line as living on $5.50 a day or less. The World Bank predicts growth this year in the developing East Asia and Pacific region will slow to 2.1% in its baseline scenario. This compares with an estimated expansion of 5.8% for 2019. The bank said precise growth forecasts were difficult, given the rapidly changing situation. “The good news is that the region has strengths it can tap, but countries will have to act fast and at a scale not previously imagined,” said Victoria Kwakwa, vice president for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank. The latest economic data from China on Tuesday gave a glimmer of hope, as they suggested factory activity rebounded in March following a big contraction in February. China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a stronger-than-expected 52 this month after hitting a record low of 35.7 in February. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. However, Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said the figure did not mean that output was now back to its pre-virus trend. \"Instead, it simply suggests that economic activity improved modestly relative to February's dismal showing, but remains well below pre-virus levels,\" he said. The World Bank's outlook is grim - to say the least. Unavoidable significant pain in all countries - that's the World Bank's forecast for growth in the East Asia region this year. The poor will get poorer - and there will be more of them - and even rich countries will struggle to keep businesses and households afloat. In China, where the outbreak began, the bank says the virus's impact on the economy will see growth slow to 2.3% this year from 6.1% last year. But that's if the pandemic doesn't get worse. If it does, growth could be just 0.1% this year. The bank's forecasts for other countries in east Asia are similarly grim. Worse still, according to the bank, will be the serious impact on poverty, both directly through illness and indirectly through lost incomes. Those in the informal sector will be hardest hit, and will need the most help. Asia - and in particular China - has been the world's economic engine for the past decade. The coronavirus pandemic has stopped that growth in its tracks. Recovery will be long and difficult.", "summary0": "The financial impact of coronavirus will stop almost 24 million people from escaping poverty in East Asia and the Pacific, according to the World Bank.", "url1": "https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-52106233", "lang1": "hausa", "text1": "Bankin ya bayyana cewa ''za a samu matsin tattalin arziki a duka kasashen duniya''.

Half a century after his death, Reality Check looks at how the racial and ethnic make-up of Congress and state legislatures has changed. The US Congress is made up of 435 elected lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber, and 100 in the Senate, the upper chamber. US politics has gradually become more diverse and this Congress is the most racially and ethnically diverse yet. Barack Obama's rise to the presidency was also seen as an important milestone. But compared to the population as a whole, many branches of political office in America are still disproportionally white. Changes in the Senate Months before Dr King was killed, Edward Brooke became the first African American to win election to the Senate by a popular vote. Mr Brooke, who represented Massachusetts and served two full terms, was known for his work in promoting low-income housing, and racial equality in the South. Seven African-American senators have served since then, two of them women. In Congress as a whole, the number of African-, Hispanic- and Asian-American citizens has steadily increased in the last few decades. But lawmakers are still overwhelmingly white. In the last half a century, the total minority population in the US has more than doubled. But while about one fifth of the most recent Congress was from a minority group, minorities represent about 38% of the population overall. In 2017, 3% of the Senate and 10% of the House of Representatives was African American - but that group represents about 13% of the population overall. There were similar proportions for Asian Americans (2% in the Senate, 3% in the House, but 6% overall) and Hispanic Americans (4% in the Senate, 9% in the House, but 18% overall) in Congress. What about the House of Representatives? About 23% of the House come from a minority background, a higher proportion than in the Senate. Out of the number of new Congressmen and women, 34% were from a minority group, according to Pew Research Centre. This much more closely resembles an increasingly diverse country. Almost all of the members of the House of Representatives from a minority group are in the Democratic party. The process of making politics more representative has been far less substantial among Republicans, says Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics group at American University in Washington DC. One of the reasons why it matters, says Ms Lawless, is because politicians are more likely to raise issues affecting a minority group if they have been affected by the issue themselves as a member of that group. There are two Native Americans serving in the House of Representatives: Tom Cole, of the Chickasaw tribe, represents Oklahoma, and Markwayne Mullin, of the Cherokee tribe, also represents Oklahoma. There have been three senators of known Native American descent. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a member of the North Cheyenne tribe, served until 2005. A record number of Native Americans ran for office in 2016. State politics More than 7,000 men and women are elected to serve in state legislatures. Like their counterparts in the national Congress, state lawmakers are less diverse than the whole population. Based on a study by the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) in 2015, Hawaii, followed by New Mexico, have the highest proportion of minority lawmakers in their state - 78% and 49% respectively. The state with the highest percentage of white lawmakers in 2015 was North Dakota with 99%. Minorities account for about 15% of the state's total population. Hawaii, California, the southern states on the Mexican border, Florida and some of the states along the eastern coast have the highest proportion of legislators from minority populations. States in the middle of the country and those on the northern border generally have the lowest percentage. The state with the highest proportion of African-American legislators is Mississippi, Hawaii has the highest proportion of Asian and Pacific Islanders, for Native Americans it's Montana and for Hispanic Americans it's New Mexico. Trying to assess exactly how the situation has changed since the death of Dr King is challenging as there isn't complete data for each ethnic group going back to the 1960s. But the NCSL research did reveal that the percentage of African Americans elected at the state level rose from 2% to 9% between 1971 and 2011. Hispanic Americans represent 5% of state legislators - up from 2.2% in 1991 - but well below the 18% of the total population that Hispanic Americans account for.
